OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and severity of requests biostatisticians receive from researchers for inappropriate analysis and reporting of data during statistical consultations. DESIGN: Online survey. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: A randomly drawn sample of 522 American Statistical Association members self-identifying as consulting biostatisticians. MEASUREMENTS: The Bioethical Issues in Biostatistical Consulting Questionnaire soliciting reports about the frequency and perceived severity of specific requests for inappropriate analysis and reporting. RESULTS: Of 522 consulting biostatisticians contacted, 390 provided sufficient responses: a completion rate of 74.7%. The 4 most frequently reported inappropriate requests rated as """"most severe"""" by at least 20% of the respondents were, in order of frequency, removing or altering some data records to better support the research hypothesis"," interpreting the statistical findings on the basis of expectation, not actual results", not reporting the presence of key missing data that might bias the results," and ignoring violations of assumptions that would change results from positive to negative. These requests were reported most often by younger biostatisticians. LIMITATIONS: The survey provides information on the reported frequency of inappropriate requests but not on how such requests were handled or whether the requests reflected researchers' maleficence or inadequate knowledge about statistical and research methods. In addition, other inappropriate requests may have been made that were not prespecified in the survey. CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that researchers frequently make inappropriate requests of their biostatistical consultants regarding the analysis and reporting of their data. Understanding the reasons for these requests and how they are handled requires further study.

Telehealth and telemedicine services, especially, fulfilled their promise by allowing patients to receive advice and care at a distance, making it safer for all concerned. Over the preceding years, professional societies, governments, and scholars examined ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) related to telemedicine and telehealth. Primary concerns evident from reviewing this literature have been quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. OBJECTIVES: To identify and summarize ethical, legal, and social issues related to information technology in healthcare, as exemplified by telehealth and telemedicine. To expand on prior analyses and address gaps illuminated by the COVID-19 experience. To propose future research directions. METHODS: Literature was identified through searches, forward and backward citation chaining, and the author's knowledge of scholars and works in the area. EU and professional organizations' guidelines, and nineteen scholarly papers were examined and categories created to identify ethical, legal, and social issues they addressed. A synthesis matrix was developed to categorize issues addressed by each source. RESULTS: A synthesis matrix was developed and issues categorized as: quality of care, consent and autonomy, access to care and technology, legal and regulatory, clinician responsibilities, patient responsibilities, changed relationships, commercialization, policy, information needs, and evaluation, with subcategories that fleshed out each category. The literature primarily addressed quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Other identified considerations were little discussed. These and newer concerns include: usability, tailoring services to each patient, curriculum and training, implementation, commercialization, and licensing and liability. The need for interoperability, data availability, cybersecurity, and informatics infrastructure also is more apparent. These issues are applicable to other information technologies in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and organizations need updated guidelines for ethical use of telemedicine and telehealth care, and decision- and policy-makers need evidence to inform decisions. The variety of newly implemented telemedicine services is an on-going natural experiment presenting an unparalleled opportunity to develop an evidence-based way forward. The paper recommends evaluation using an applied ethics, context-sensitive approach that explores interactions among multiple factors and considerations. It suggests evaluation questions to investigate ethical, social, and legal issues through multi-method, sociotechnical, interpretive and ethnographic, and interactionist evaluation approaches. Such evaluation can help telehealth, and other information technologies, be integrated into healthcare ethically and effectively."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104239,*COVID-19",Computer Security,Delivery of Health Care/methods,Humans,Medical Informatics/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence,Pandemics,Privacy,SARS-CoV-2,

This emerging pathway may offer promising strategies to support the mental health of medical professionals. This study seeks to investigate the association among digital leadership, organizational identity, family-work conflict, and anxiety and depression symptoms, and further to uncover the underlying moderating mechanisms interplay. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey with 657 valid data were collected from four tertiary hospitals in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China, with a response rate of 69.3%. The statistical analysis was conducted employing IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to scrutinize the pertinent factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms among medical professionals, while also evaluating the moderating influence of organizational identity and family-work conflict on the nexus among those. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among medical professionals was 50.1%. Anxiety and depression symptoms were negatively correlated with digital leadership (r= -0.278, p < 0.01) and organizational identity (r = - 0.318, p < 0.01), and positively correlated with family-work conflict (r = 0.445, p < 0.01).

Given that pharmacovigilance itself operates in a high-noise, lower-validity environment without objective 'gold standards' beyond process definitions, the introduction of large volumes of SDM into the pharmacovigilance workflow has the potential to exacerbate issues with limited manual resources to perform adverse event identification and processing. Recent advances in medical informatics have resulted in methods for developing programs which can assist human experts in the detection of valid individual case safety reports (ICSRs) within SDM. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed rule-based and machine learning (ML) models for classifying ICSRs from SDM and compared their performance with that of human pharmacovigilance experts. METHODS: We used a random sampling from a collection of 311,189 SDM posts that mentioned Roche products and brands in combination with common medical and scientific terms sourced from Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and a spectrum of news media blogs to develop and evaluate three iterations of an automated ICSR classifier. The ICSR classifier models consisted of sub-components to annotate the relevant ICSR elements and a component to make the final decision on the validity of the ICSR. Agreement with human pharmacovigilance experts was chosen as the preferred performance metric and was evaluated by calculating the Gwet AC1 statistic (gKappa). The best performing model was tested against the Roche global pharmacovigilance expert using a blind dataset and put through a time test of the full 311,189-post dataset. RESULTS: During this effort, the initial strict rule-based approach to ICSR classification resulted in a model with an accuracy of 65% and a gKappa of 46%. Adding an ML-based adverse event annotator improved the accuracy to 74% and gKappa to 60%. This was further improved by the addition of an additional ML ICSR detector. On a blind test set of 2500 posts, the final model demonstrated a gKappa of 78% and an accuracy of 83%. In the time test, it took the final model 48 h to complete a task that would have taken an estimated 44,000 h for human experts to perform. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that an effective and scalable solution to the challenge of ICSR detection in SDM includes a workflow using an automated ML classifier to identify likely ICSRs for further human SME review."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s40264-018-0641-7,""Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*statistics & numerical data",Blogging/statistics & numerical data,Data Mining/*methods,"Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data",Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*etiology,Humans,Internet/statistics & numerical data,

However, challenges persist in collecting feedback from vulnerable groups, those with severe conditions, or language barriers. Furthermore, concerns exist about the credibility and validity of the feedback received. This study aims to explore various possible forms that general practitioners (GPs) could use to collect patient feedback on eHealth applications in their daily practice. METHODS: A Participatory Research (PR) was conducted involving an advisory group, patients, GPs and medical receptionists. The advisory group consisting of GPs, a board member, patient representatives and digital care manager affiliated with the primary care organisation 'Regionale Organisatie Huisartsen Amsterdam' (ROHA). The group provided input throughout the research process from the setup, data collection and interpretation to the finalization phase. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 patients, 8 GPs and 2 medical receptionists. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling. Interviews were coded using Thematic Analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were considered important. First, timing of feedback. Gathering instant feedback immediately after digital interactions was considered important. Secondly, the feedback procedure, whereby feedback should be given through the same communication channel as was used for the doctor-patient contact was valued. Also, participants preferred short and specific surveys, in which they can remain anonymous. Thirdly, for the feedback content some key feedback topics included general experiences, quality of care and technical aspects. The last theme was advertisement. Overall, patients do not want to burden their GP and thus tend to only give feedback if initiated by their GP. GPs themselves pointed out to have limited time for collecting feedback from patients due to their workload. CONCLUSION: GPs can optimize the feedback collection process by selecting targeted questions and integrating them into existing eHealth applications, thereby investing minimal time from GPs and patients. It is recommended to include automatic selected questions at the end of e-consultations. This integrated approach allows efficient feedback collection without burdening GPs."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12875-025-02725-0,Humans",*Telemedicine,*General Practice/methods,Female,Male,*Feedback,Middle Aged,Adult,

For example, the targeted cancer therapy is primarily based on the information which clinically important SNPs are detectable from the tumor. Many hospitals have developed their own panels that include clinically important SNPs. The genome information exchange between the patient and the hospital has become more popular. However, the genome sequence information is innate and irreversible and thus its leakage has serious consequences. Therefore, protecting one's genome information is critical. On the other side, hospitals may need to protect their own panels. There is no known secure SNP panel scheme to protect both. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a secure SNP panel scheme using homomorphically encrypted K-mers without requiring SNP calling on the user side and without revealing the panel information to the user. Use of the powerful homomorphic encryption technique is desirable, but there is no known algorithm to efficiently align two homomorphically encrypted sequences. Thus, we designed and implemented a novel secure SNP panel scheme utilizing the computationally feasible equality test on two homomorphically encrypted K-mers. To make the scheme work correctly, in addition to SNPs in the panel, sequence variations at the population level should be addressed. We designed a concept of Point Deviation Tolerance (PDT) level to address the false positives and false negatives. Using the TCGA BRCA dataset, we demonstrated that our scheme works at the level of over a hundred thousand somatic mutations. In addition, we provide a computational guideline for the panel design, including the size of K-mer and the number of SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is the first of its kind to protect both the user's sequence and the hospital's panel information using the powerful homomorphic encryption scheme. We demonstrated that the scheme works with a simulated dataset and the TCGA BRCA dataset. In this study, we have shown only the feasibility of the proposed scheme and much more efforts should be done to make the scheme usable for clinical use."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-019-5473-z,""Algorithms",Cloud Computing/*standards,*Computer Security,Data Mining/*methods,Genomics/*methods,Humans,"*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"",30967116,PMC6456943",,

Paralleling this trend is the growth in the telehealth industry, with sharp increases in the number of platforms, functionalities, and levels of integrations within both the electronic health record and other technical systems supporting health care. When a telehealth network is intended to be used across independent health care systems, an additional layer of complexity emerges. In the context of regionalized telehealth networks that are not within the same health care system, not only are technical interoperability challenges a practical barrier, but administrative, clinical, and competitive elements also quickly emerge, resulting in fragmented, siloed technologies. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to describe a statewide approach to deploying an interoperable open access telehealth network across multiple health systems. METHODS: One promising solution to the abovementioned concerns is an open access telehealth network. In the field of telehealth, an open access network (OAN) can be defined as a network infrastructure that can be used by health care providers without a closed or proprietary platform, specific obligatory network, or service-specific telehealth technologies. This framework for the development of an OAN is grounded in practical examples of clinical programs that function in each stage of network maturity based on the experience of the South Carolina Telehealth Alliance (SCTA). The SCTA's experience details successes and challenges in an ongoing effort to achieve an OAN. The model describes an OAN in stages of collaborative maturity and provides insights into the technological, clinical, and administrative implications of making the collaboration possible. RESULTS: The four stages of an OAN are defined according to operational maturity, ranging from feasibility to demonstration of implementation. Each stage is associated with infrastructure and resource requirements and technical and clinical activities. In stage 1, technical standards are agreed upon, and the clinical programs are designed to utilize compliant technologies. In stage 2, collaboration is demonstrated through technical teams working together to address barriers, whereas clinical and administrative teams share best practices. In stage 3, a functional interoperable network is demonstrated with different institutions providing service through common telehealth end points at different patient care sites. In stage 4, clinical workflows are streamlined and standardized across institutions, and economies of scale are achieved through technical and administrative innovations. CONCLUSIONS: The approach to OAN development described provides a roadmap for achieving a functional telehealth network across independent health systems. The South Carolina experience reveals both successes and challenges in achieving this goal. The next steps toward the development of OANs include advocacy and ongoing engagement with the developers of telehealth technologies regarding their commitment to interoperability."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/17348,Access to Information/*ethics",Delivery of Health Care/*standards,Humans,Medical Informatics/*methods,South Carolina,"Telemedicine/*standards,32441657,PMC7275254",,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2015 and February 2016, we fielded a questionnaire in PatientsLikeMe, an online patient community representing over 2500 health conditions. The questionnaire was developed using subject matter expertise and patient feedback from a concept elicitation phase (N = 57 patients). The final questionnaire consisted of 37 items. RESULTS: Of n = 5741 who opened the email invitation, n = 3516 respondents completed the questionnaire (61.2%).

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We developed an R package and a corresponding web application to streamline statistical transformations in meta-analysis. A parallel randomized controlled trial following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines was conducted. The trial was preregistered, and ethical approval was obtained from the University of Krems' ethics committee. We conducted a parallel randomized controlled trial with 26 participants, including researchers and students with varying levels of statistical expertise. Participants performed six statistical calculations commonly used in meta-analysis: computing pooled standard deviations, converting standard errors, and calculating standardized mean differences for both 2-group and 3-arm studies. Performance was evaluated based on accuracy and time taken to complete each task. A Bayesian mixed-effects model was used to analyze the results. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (metaHelper) or the control group (allowed to use internet sources, the Cochrane Handbook, or any other sources chosen by the participant). RESULTS: Main outcomes were correctness of calculations and time taken to complete tasks. The metaHelper group had a higher probability of providing correct answers (85%) compared to the control group (31%). Additionally, the metaHelper group completed an average of 133 seconds per task faster (95% credibility interval: 83-180). CONCLUSION: MetaHelper effectively enhances the accuracy and efficiency of statistical transformations required for meta-analysis. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Meta-analysis, a method for combining research results, often requires researchers to transform statistical data, like converting standard errors to standard deviations. These transformations are critical can be prone to errors, especially when done manually or with limited guidance. To address this, we developed metaHelper (www.metahelper.eu), a user-friendly web application and R package designed to assist researchers with these calculations. In our study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare metaHelper with traditional methods like handbook instructions and freely available online tools (whatever our participants wanted to use). Twenty-six researchers and students participated, performing 6 common statistical calculations. We measured their accuracy and the time they took to complete each task.

In rural Ghana, challenges with access to diagnostic services demotivate women from ANC attendance and referral compliance, leading to absent or late identification and management of high-risk women. In 2016, an integrated diagnostic and clinical decision support system tagged 'Bliss4Midwives' (B4M), was piloted in Northern Ghana. The device facilitated non-invasive screening of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and anaemia at the point-of-care. This study aimed to explore the experiences of pregnant women with B4M, and its influence on service utilisation (""""pull effect"""") and woman-provider relationships (""""woman engagement""""). METHODS: Through an embedded study design, qualitative methods including individual semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation were employed. Interviews were conducted with 20 pregnant women and 10 health workers, supplemented by ANC observations in intervention facilities. Secondary data on ANC registrations over a one-year period were extracted from health facility records to support findings on the perceived influence of B4M on service utilisation. RESULTS: Women's first impressions of the device were mostly emotive (excitement, fear), but sometimes neutral. Although it is inconclusive whether B4M increased ANC registration, pregnant women generally valued the availability of diagnostic services at the point-of-care. Additionally, by fostering some level of engagement, the intervention made women feel listened to and cared for. Process outcomes of the B4M encounter also showed that it was perceived as improving the skills and knowledge of the health worker, which facilitated trust in diagnostic recommendations and was therefore believed to motivate referral compliance. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that mHealth diagnostic and decision support devices enhance woman engagement and trust in health workers skills.

Yet, the presence of these small RNAs in Plasmodium spp. remains unknown. Systematic identification and characterization of tRFs is therefore highly needed to understand further their roles in Plasmodium parasites, particularly in the virulent Plasmodium falciparum parasite. RESULTS: Genome-wide small RNAs with sizes ranging from 18-30 nucleotides from P. falciparum were deep-sequenced via Illumina HiSeq 2000 technology. In-depth analysis revealed the presence of a vast number of small RNAs originating from tRNA-coding genes, responsible for 22.4% of the total reads as the second predominant group. Three P. falciparum-derived tRF types (ptRFs) were identified as 5'ptRFs, mid-ptRFs and 3'ptRFs. The majority (90%) of ptRFs were derived from tRNAs that coded eight amino acids: Pro, Phe, Asn, Gly, Cys, Gln, His and Ala. Stem-loop reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction further confirmed the presence of tRFs in the blood stages of P. falciparum. Four new motifs with an enriched G/C feature were determined at cleavage sites that might guide the generation of ptRFs. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genome-wide investigation of ptRFs from Plasmodium species.

Recently, we compared the lung transcriptomic profile between two mouse strains with extreme total lung capacities to identify plausible pulmonary function determining genes using microarray analysis (GSE80078). Advancement of high-throughput techniques like deep sequencing (eg. RNA-seq) and microarray have resulted in an explosion of genomic data in the online public repositories which however remains under-exploited. Strategic curation of publicly available genomic data with a mouse-human translational approach can effectively implement """"3R- Tenet"""" by reducing screening experiments with animals and performing mechanistic studies using physiologically relevant in vitro model systems. Therefore, we sought to analyze the association of functional variations within human orthologs of mouse lung function candidate genes in a publicly available COPD lung RNA-seq data-set. METHODS: Association of missense single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, deletions, and splice junction variants were analyzed for susceptibility to COPD using RNA-seq data of a Korean population (GSE57148). Expression of the associated genes were studied using the Gene Paint (mouse embryo) and Human Protein Atlas (normal adult human lung) databases. The genes were also assessed for replication of the associations and expression in COPD-/mouse cigarette smoke exposed lung tissues using other datasets. RESULTS: Significant association (p <  0.05) of variations in 20 genes to higher COPD susceptibility have been detected within the investigated cohort. Association of HJURP, MCRS1 and TLR8 are novel in relation to COPD. The associated ADAM19 and KIT loci have been reported earlier. The remaining 15 genes have also been previously associated to COPD. Differential transcript expression levels of the associated genes in COPD- and/ or mouse emphysematous lung tissues have been detected. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest strategic mouse-human datamining approaches can identify novel COPD candidate genes using existing datasets in the online repositories. The candidates can be further evaluated for mechanistic role through in vitro studies using appropriate primary cells/cell lines. Functional studies can be limited to transgenic animal models of only well supported candidate genes. This approach will lead to a significant reduction of animal experimentation in respiratory research."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12931-018-0795-y,""Animals",Cohort Studies,Data Mining/*methods,"Databases, Genetic/trends",Female,Genetic Association Studies/*methods,*Genetic Research,Humans,

However, it is still an open question on how to extract the robust gene features. METHODS: In this work, a gene signature selection strategy for TCGA data was proposed by integrating the gene expression data, the methylation data and the prior knowledge about cancer biomarkers. Different from the traditional integration method, the expanded 450 K methylation data were applied instead of the original 450 K array data, and the reported biomarkers were weighted in the feature selection. Fuzzy rule based classification method and cross validation strategy were applied in the model construction for performance evaluation. RESULTS: Our selected gene features showed prediction accuracy close to 100% in the cross validation with fuzzy rule based classification model on 6 cancers from TCGA. The cross validation performance of our proposed model is similar to other integrative models or RNA-seq only model, while the prediction performance on independent data is obviously better than other 5 models. The gene signatures extracted with our fuzzy rule based integrative feature selection strategy were more robust, and had the potential to get better prediction results. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the integration of expanded methylation data would cover more genes, and had greater capacity to retrieve the signature genes compared with the original 450 K methylation data. Also, the integration of the reported biomarkers was a promising way to improve the performance. PTCHD3 gene was selected as a discriminating gene in 3 out of the 6 cancers, which suggested that it might play important role in the cancer risk and would be worthy for the intensive investigation."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12920-018-0451-x,""Computational Biology/*methods",*Fuzzy Logic,*Gene Expression Profiling,"Genome, Human/genetics",Genomics/*methods,Humans,"Neoplasms/*genetics"",30704464,PMC6357346",,

Recent research using high-throughput transcriptomic approaches has led to a dramatic increase in the discovery of bacterial sRNAs. However, it is generally believed that the currently identified sRNAs constitute a limited subset of the bacterial sRNA repertoire. In several cases, sRNAs belonging to a specific class are already known and the challenge is to identify additional sRNAs belonging to the same class. In such cases, machine-learning approaches can be used to predict novel sRNAs in a given class. METHODS: In this work, we develop novel bioinformatics approaches that integrate sequence and structure-based features to train machine-learning models for the discovery of bacterial sRNAs. We show that features derived from recurrent structural motifs in the ensemble of low energy secondary structures can distinguish the RNA classes with high accuracy. RESULTS: We apply this approach to predict new members in two broad classes of bacterial small RNAs: 1) sRNAs that bind to the RNA-binding protein RsmA/CsrA in diverse bacterial species and 2) sRNAs regulated by the master regulator of virulence, ToxT, in Vibrio cholerae. CONCLUSION: The involvement of sRNAs in bacterial adaptation to changing environments is an increasingly recurring theme in current research in microbiology. It is likely that future research, combining experimental and computational approaches, will discover many more examples of sRNAs as components of critical regulatory pathways in bacteria. We have developed a novel approach for prediction of small RNA regulators in important bacterial pathways. This approach can be applied to specific classes of sRNAs for which several members have been identified and the challenge is to identify additional sRNAs."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-017-4057-z,""Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism",Base Sequence,Computational Biology/*methods,*Machine Learning,"RNA, Bacterial/*genetics","Vibrio cholerae/*genetics"",28830349,PMC5568370",,,

Therefore, data sharing in neuroimaging requires special attention to protect participants' privacy. Facial features removal (FFR) could alleviate these concerns. We assessed the impact of three FFR methods on subsequent automated image analysis to obtain clinically relevant outcome measurements in three clinical groups. METHODS: FFR was performed using QuickShear, FaceMasking, and Defacing. In 110 subjects of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, normalized brain volumes (NBV) were measured by SIENAX. In 70 multiple sclerosis patients of the MAGNIMS Study Group, lesion volumes (WMLV) were measured by lesion prediction algorithm in lesion segmentation toolbox. In 84 glioblastoma patients of the PICTURE Study Group, tumor volumes (GBV) were measured by BraTumIA. Failed analyses on FFR-processed images were recorded. Only cases in which all image analyses completed successfully were analyzed. Differences between outcomes obtained from FFR-processed and full images were assessed, by quantifying the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for absolute agreement and by testing for systematic differences using paired t tests. RESULTS: Automated analysis methods failed in 0-19% of cases in FFR-processed images versus 0-2% of cases in full images. ICC for absolute agreement ranged from 0.312 (GBV after FaceMasking) to 0.998 (WMLV after Defacing). FaceMasking yielded higher NBV (p = 0.003) and WMLV (p = 0.001). GBV was lower after QuickShear and Defacing (both p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: All three outcome measures were affected differently by FFR, including failure of analysis methods and both """"random"""" variation and systematic differences. Further study is warranted to ensure high-quality neuroimaging research while protecting participants' privacy. KEY POINTS: ? Protecting participants' privacy when sharing MRI data is important. ?

The performance of the proposed method is comprehensively validated by using both breast cancer and prostate cancer datasets, and by comparison with other methods.

We compared a newly developed time-to-event (TTE) display with two established absolute risk displays (i.e. emoticons and bar charts). The accessibility, that is, how understandable, helpful, and trustworthy patients found each display, was also investigated. METHODS: We analysed a sample of 353 patients recruited in general practices. After giving consent, patients were introduced to one of three fictional vignettes with low, medium or high cardiovascular risk. All three risk displays were shown in a randomized order. Patients were asked to rate each display with regard to motivation for SDM and accessibility. Two-factorial repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted to compare the displays and investigate possible interactions with age. RESULTS: Regarding motivation for SDM, the TTE elicited the highest motivation, followed by the emoticons and bar chart (p < .001). The displays had no differential influence on the age groups (p = .445). While the TTE was generally rated more accessible than the emoticons and bar chart (p < .001), the emoticons were only superior to the bar chart in the younger subsample. However, this was only to a small effect (interaction between display and age, p < .01, ? (2)  = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Using fictional case vignettes, the novel TTE display was superior regarding motivation for SDM and accessibility when compared to established displays using emoticons and a bar chart.

Genomics research plays a crucial role in understanding the emergence, spread and containment measures of AMR. However, its implementation in such settings is particularly challenging due to limited human capacity. This manuscript outlines a three-day bioinformatics workshop in Cameroon, highlighting efforts to build human capacity for genomics research to support AMR surveillance using readily accessible and user-friendly web-based tools. The workshop introduced participants to basic next-generation sequencing concepts, data file formats used in bacterial genomics, data sharing procedures and considerations, as well as the use of web-based bioinformatics software to analyse genomic data, including in silico prediction of AMR, phylogenetics analyses, and a quick introduction to Linux© command line. RESULTS: Briefly, a substantial increase in participants' confidence in bioinformatics knowledge and skills was observed before and after the workshop. Notably, before the workshop most participants lacked confidence in their ability to identify next-generation sequencing technologies or workflows (64%) and analyse genetic data using web-based bioinformatics tools (81%). After the workshop, majority of participants were extremely confident using NCBI BLAST and other web-based bioinformatics tools for data analysis with a score = 5 among which 45%, 9% and 18% had a score of 8, 9, and 10, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this training approach in empowering local researchers and bridging the bioinformatics gap in genomics surveillance of AMR in resource-constrained settings. We provide a detailed description of the relevant training approaches used, including workshop structure, the selection and planning, and utilization of freely available web-based tools, and the evaluation methods employed. Our approach aimed to overcome limitations such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to computational resources, and scarcity of expertise. By leveraging the power of freely available web-based tools, we demonstrated how participants can acquire fundamental bioinformatics skills, enhance their understanding of biological data analysis, and contribute to the field, even in an underprivileged environment.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of imaging parameters derived from PCT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: 36 patients with liver cirrhosis and a total of 67 lesions referred to our hospital for multi-parametric diagnosis of HCC-suspected liver lesions in the setting of liver cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled and underwent PCT and MRI. HCC diagnosis was confirmed either by histology (n = 60) or interval growth (n = 7). For PCT, mean/max blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), k-trans, arterial liver perfusion (ALP), portal venous perfusion (PVP) and hepatic perfusion index (HPI) were quantified.

Our analysis builds on ethnographic studies within the Danish healthcare system, which is internationally known for its high degree of digitalization and well-connected data infrastructures. Although data repurposing ought to be relatively seamless in this context, we demonstrate how it involves costs and trade-offs for those who produce and use health data.

The manual breast cancer diagnosis utilizes more time and is subjective. Also, the previous CAD models mostly depend on manmade visual details that are complex to generalize across ultrasound images utilizing distinct techniques. Distinct imaging tools have been utilized in previous works such as mammography and MRI. However, these imaging tools are costly and less portable than ultrasound imaging. Also, ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive method commonly used for breast cancer screening. Hence, the paper presents a novel deep learning model, BCDNet, for classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant using ultrasound images. AIM: The primary aim of the study is to design an effective breast cancer diagnosis model that can accurately classify tumors in their early stages, thus reducing mortality rates. The model aims to optimize the weight and parameters using the RPAOSM-ESO algorithm to enhance accuracy and minimize false negative rates. METHODS: The BCDNet model utilizes transfer learning from a pre-trained VGG16 network for feature extraction and employs an AHDNAM classification approach, which includes ASPP, DTCN, 1DCNN, and an attention mechanism. The RPAOSM-ESO algorithm is used to fine-tune the weights and parameters. RESULTS: The RPAOSM-ESO-BCDNet-based breast cancer diagnosis model provided 94.5 accuracy rates. This value is relatively higher than the previous models such as DTCN (88.2), 1DCNN (89.6), MobileNet (91.3), and ASPP-DTC-1DCNN-AM (93.8). Hence, it is guaranteed that the designed RPAOSM-ESO-BCDNet produces relatively accurate solutions for the classification than the previous models. CONCLUSION: The BCDNet model, with its sophisticated feature extraction and classification techniques optimized by the RPAOSM-ESO algorithm, shows promise in accurately classifying breast tumors using ultrasound images. The study suggests that the model could be a valuable tool in the early detection of breast cancer, potentially saving lives and reducing the burden on healthcare systems."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12880-024-01538-4,""Humans",*Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging,Female,*Deep Learning,"Ultrasonography, Mammary/methods",Algorithms,"Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods"",39780045,PMC11707918",,

A traditional approach (causal steps or change in coefficient) was most commonly taken (n = 87, 58%), and the majority of studies (n = 114, 77%) used a Cox Proportional Hazards regression for the outcome. Few studies (n = 52, 35%) mentioned any of the assumptions or limitations fundamental to a causal interpretation of mediation analysis. CONCLUSION: There is increasing use of mediation analysis with time-to-event outcomes. Current usage is limited by reliance on traditional methods and the Cox Proportional Hazards model, as well as low rates of reporting of underlying assumptions. There is a need for formal criteria to aid authors, reviewers, and readers reporting or appraising such studies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-018-0578-7,""*Data Interpretation, Statistical",Delivery of Health Care/methods/statistics & numerical data,"*Effect Modifier, Epidemiologic",Health Services Research/methods/*statistics & numerical data,Humans,"Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods/*statistics & numerical data",Proportional Hazards Models,Survival Analysis,

However, the use of multi-software and cross-platform strategies has increased the complexity of phylogenetic tree estimation. Therefore, the development and application of streamlined phylogenetic analysis tools are growing in significance in the field of biology. Particularly for genomes with relatively short sequences, there is a lack of simple and integrative tools for phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: In this study, we present CamlTree (Concatenated alignments maximum-likelihood tree), a user-friendly desktop software designed to simplify phylogenetic analysis for viral and mitochondrial genomes, ultimately facilitating related research. CamlTree provides a workflow including gene concatenation (or coalescence), sequence alignment, alignment optimization, and the estimation of phylogenetic trees using both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. CamlTree was written in TypeScript and developed using the Electron framework. It offers a primarily user-friendly interface based on the React framework. CONCLUSIONS: CamlTree software has been released for the Windows OS. It integrates several popular analysis tools to optimize and simplify the process of estimating polygenic phylogenetic trees. The establishment of software can assist researchers in reducing their workload and enhancing data processing efficiency, enabling them to expedite their research progress.

Social robots may be able to respond to the shortage of pharmaceutical personnel at community pharmacies. However, there is a lack of previous studies regarding the use of social robots for medication counselling purposes in a pharmacy setting. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this qualitative study was to explore pharmacists' views on the potential role of social robots in medication counselling. METHODS: Pharmacists, purposively sampled based on having recent experience of counselling customers in community pharmacies in Finland, first acted as customers interacting with the social robot in a simulated setting, before taking part in a focus group where their perspectives were explored. The focus group discussions were conducted in October and November 2022. The qualitative data was transcribed and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The number of participants was eight in total. A main theme of how the robot may either help or harm concerning medication safety within a pharmacy setting was identified. The six sub-themes found, according to pharmacists' views on robot counselling in community pharmacies, are context, digital competence, customer integrity, interaction, pharmacists' professional role and human skills. CONCLUSIONS: According to the study findings, pharmacists experience that the social robot can offer a potential complement to a human pharmacist. The robot is seen as beneficial with respect to certain customer groups and in the light of personnel shortages, and may in the future add to trust, equality, freedom of choice and multilingualism, among other things, in the customer service situation at community pharmacies, thus improving medication safety."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.rcsop.2024.100425,"""",38486610,PMC10937306",,,,,,,,

Patients with advanced disease often have a poor quality of life, such that guidelines recommend providing palliative care in their last year of life. Uptake and use of palliative care in advanced COPD is low"," difficulty in predicting 1-year mortality is thought to be a major contributing factor. METHODS: We identified two primary care COPD cohorts using UK electronic healthcare records (Clinical Practice Research Datalink). The first cohort was randomised equally into training and test sets. An external dataset was drawn from a second cohort. A risk model to predict mortality within 12 months was derived from the training set using backwards elimination Cox regression. The model was given the acronym BARC based on putative prognostic factors including body mass index and blood results (B), age (A), respiratory variables (airflow obstruction, exacerbations, smoking) (R) and comorbidities (C). The BARC index predictive performance was validated in the test set and external dataset by assessing calibration and discrimination. The observed and expected probabilities of death were assessed for increasing quartiles of mortality risk (very low risk, low risk, moderate risk, high risk). The BARC index was compared to the established index scores body mass index, obstructive, dyspnoea and exacerbations (BODEx), dyspnoea, obstruction, smoking and exacerbations (DOSE) and age, dyspnoea and obstruction (ADO). RESULTS: Fifty-four thousand nine hundred ninety patients were eligible from the first cohort and 4931 from the second cohort. Eighteen variables were included in the BARC, including age, airflow obstruction, body mass index, smoking, exacerbations and comorbidities. The risk model had acceptable predictive performance (test set: C-index = 0.79, 95% CI 0.78-0.81, D-statistic = 1.87, 95% CI 1.77-1.96, calibration slope = 0.95, 95% CI 0.9-0.99"," external dataset: C-index = 0.67, 95% CI 0.65-0.7, D-statistic = 0.98, 95% CI 0.8-1.2, calibration slope = 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.64) and acceptable accuracy predicting the probability of death (probability of death in 1 year, n high-risk group, test set: expected = 0.31, observed = 0.30"," external dataset: expected = 0.22, observed = 0.27).

Assembling viral transcripts is crucial for virology research and the development of antiviral strategies. However, traditional transcript assembly methods primarily designed for variable alternative splicing events in eukaryotes are not suitable for the viral transcript assembly problem. The current algorithms designed for assembling viral transcripts often struggle with low accuracy in determining the transcript boundaries. There is an urgent need to develop a highly accurate viral transcript assembly algorithm. RESULTS: In this work, we propose Cov-trans, a reference-based transcript assembler specifically tailored for the discontinuous transcription of coronaviruses. Cov-trans first identifies canonical transcripts based on discontinuous transcription mechanisms, start and stop codons, as well as reads alignment information. Subsequently, it formulates the assembly of non-canonical transcripts as a path extraction problem, and introduces a mixed integer linear programming to recover these non-canonical transcripts.

Image analysis is performed based on dedicated software. The manufacturers provide different analysis tools whose algorithms are often unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of software on quantification of left ventricular (LV) assessment, 2D flow measurement and T1- and T2-parametric mapping. METHODS: Thirty-one data sets of patients who underwent a CMR Scan on 1.5 T were analyzed using three different software (Circle CVI: cvi(42), Siemens Healthineers: Argus, Medis: Qmass/Qflow) by one reader blinded to former results. Cine steady state free precession short axis images were analyzed regarding LV ejection fraction (EF), end-systolic and end-diastolic volume (ESV, EDV) and LV mass. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance images were evaluated for forward stroke volume (SV) and peak velocity (Vmax). Pixel-wise generated native T1- and T2-maps were used to assess T1- and T2-time. Forty-five data sets were evaluated twice (15 per software) for intraobserver analysis. Equivalence was considered if the confidence interval of a paired assessment of two sofware was within a tolerance interval defined by ±1.96 highest standard deviation obtained by intraobserver analysis. RESULTS: For each parameter, thirty data sets could be analyzed with all three software. All three software (A/B, A/C, B/C) were considered equivalent for LV EF, EDV, ESV, mass, 2D flow SV and T2-time. Differences between software were detected in flow measurement for Vmax and in parametric mapping for T1-time. For Vmax, equivalence was given between software A and C and for T1-time equivalence was given between software B and C. CONCLUSION: Software had no impact on quantitative results of LV assessment, T2-time and SV based on 2D flow. In contrast to that, Vmax and T1-time may be influenced by software.

Imported cases correspond to approximately 90% of extra-Amazonian cases. Imported malaria could be a major problem if it occurs in areas with receptivity, because it can favor the occurrence of outbreaks or reintroductions of malaria in those areas. This study aimed to model territorial receptivity for malaria to serve as an entomological surveillance tool in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Geomorphology, rainfall, temperature, and vegetation layers were used in the AHP process for the receptivity stratification of Rio de Janeiro State territory. RESULTS: The model predicted five receptivity classes: very low, low, medium, high and very high. The 'very high' class is the most important in the receptivity model, corresponding to areas with optimal environmental and climatological conditions to provide suitable larval habitats for Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) vectors. This receptivity class covered 497.14 km(2) or 1.18% of the state's area. The 'high' class covered the largest area, 17,557.98 km(2), or 41.62% of the area of Rio de Janeiro State. CONCLUSIONS: We used freely available databases for modeling the distribution of receptive areas for malaria transmission in the State of Rio de Janeiro. This was a new and low-cost approach to support entomological surveillance efforts. Health workers in 'very high' and 'high' receptivity areas should be prepared to diagnose all febrile individuals and determine the cause of the fever, including malaria.

Testimonies were thematically analyzed and synthesized to identify and discuss shared themes. RESULTS: Researchers from seven European countries, Argentina, Canada, Australia, and the United States answered the call. Four themes emerged that indicate shared challenges in legislation, IRB inefficiencies and inconsistencies, general regulation and costs, and lack of HOF study knowledge by IRB members. We propose a model for IRB review of HOF studies based on best practices. CONCLUSION: International criteria are needed that define low and high-risk HOF studies, to allow identification of studies that can undergo an expedited (or exempted) process from those that need full IRB review. Enhancing IRB processes in such a way would be beneficial to the conduct of HOF studies.

Although these technologies are frequently used in biological studies, NGS data analysis remains a challenging, time-consuming, and often irreproducible process. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and flexible workflow platform that can accelerate data processing and analysis so more time can be spent on functional studies. RESULTS: We have developed an integrative, stand-alone workflow platform, named CIPHER, for the systematic analysis of several commonly used NGS datasets including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, GRO-seq, and ATAC-seq data. CIPHER implements various open source software packages, in-house scripts, and Docker containers to analyze and process single-ended and pair-ended datasets. CIPHER's pipelines conduct extensive quality and contamination control checks, as well as comprehensive downstream analysis. A typical CIPHER workflow includes: (1) raw sequence evaluation, (2) read trimming and adapter removal, (3) read mapping and quality filtering, (4) visualization track generation, and (5) extensive quality control assessment. Furthermore, CIPHER conducts downstream analysis such as: narrow and broad peak calling, peak annotation, and motif identification for ChIP-seq, differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq, nucleosome positioning for MNase-seq, DNase hypersensitive site mapping, site annotation and motif identification for DNase-seq, analysis of nascent transcription from Global-Run On (GRO-seq) data, and characterization of chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq datasets. In addition, CIPHER contains an """"analysis"""" mode that completes complex bioinformatics tasks such as enhancer discovery and provides functions to integrate various datasets together. CONCLUSIONS: Using public and simulated data, we demonstrate that CIPHER is an efficient and comprehensive workflow platform that can analyze several NGS datasets commonly used in genome biology studies.

The use of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel opportunity to enhance the informed consent process by combining advanced information retrieval capabilities with simulated emotional responsiveness. However, the ethical implications of simulated empathy raise concerns about patient autonomy, trust and transparency. This paper examines the challenges of surgical informed consent, the potential benefits and limitations of digital tools such as LLMs and the ethical implications of simulated empathy. We distinguish between active empathy, which carries the risk of creating a misleading illusion of emotional connection and passive empathy, which focuses on recognising and signalling patient distress cues, such as fear or uncertainty, rather than attempting to simulate genuine empathy. We argue that LLMs should be limited to the latter, recognising and signalling patient distress cues and alerting healthcare providers to patient anxiety. This approach preserves the authenticity of human empathy while leveraging the analytical strengths of LLMs to assist surgeons in addressing patient concerns. This paper highlights how LLMs can ethically enhance the informed consent process without undermining the relational integrity essential to patient-centred care. By maintaining transparency and respecting the irreplaceable role of human empathy, LLMs can serve as valuable tools to support, rather than replace, the relational trust essential to informed consent."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Janaina""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/jme-2024-110652,"""",40074323,",,,,,,,,

Recent technological advances include digital health interventions for helping employees prevent and manage their stress at work effectively. Although such digital solutions come with an array of ethical risks, especially if they involve biomedical big data, the incorporation of employees' values in their design and deployment has been widely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: To bridge this gap, we used the value sensitive design (VSD) framework to identify relevant values concerning a digital stress management intervention (dSMI) at the workplace, assess how users comprehend these values, and derive specific requirements for an ethics-informed design of dSMIs. VSD is a theoretically grounded framework that front-loads ethics by accounting for values throughout the design process of a technology. METHODS: We conducted a literature search to identify relevant values of dSMIs at the workplace. To understand how potential users comprehend these values and derive design requirements, we conducted a web-based study that contained closed and open questions with employees of a Swiss company, allowing both quantitative and qualitative analyses. RESULTS: The values health and well-being, privacy, autonomy, accountability, and identity were identified through our literature search. Statistical analysis of 170 responses from the web-based study revealed that the intention to use and perceived usefulness of a dSMI were moderate to high. Employees' moderate to high health and well-being concerns included worries that a dSMI would not be effective or would even amplify their stress levels. Privacy concerns were also rated on the higher end of the score range, whereas concerns regarding autonomy, accountability, and identity were rated lower. Moreover, a personalized dSMI with a monitoring system involving a machine learning-based analysis of data led to significantly higher privacy (P=.009) and accountability concerns (P=.04) than a dSMI without a monitoring system. In addition, integrability, user-friendliness, and digital independence emerged as novel values from the qualitative analysis of 85 text responses. CONCLUSIONS: Although most surveyed employees were willing to use a dSMI at the workplace, there were considerable health and well-being concerns with regard to effectiveness and problem perpetuation. For a minority of employees who value digital independence, a nondigital offer might be more suitable.

Most studies examining the relationships of walkability and adiposity are cross-sectional in design. We examined the longitudinal relationships of two walkability indices - conventional walkability and space syntax walkability, and their individual components, with weight change among adults over four years. METHODS: Data were from the Physical Activity in Localities and Community study in Adelaide, Australia. In 2003-2004, 2650 adults living in 154 Census Collection Districts (CCDs) returned baseline questionnaires"," in 2007-2008, the follow-up survey was completed by 1098. Participants reported their weight at baseline and at follow-up. Neighbourhood walkability indices were calculated using geographic information systems and space syntax software. Linear marginal models using generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors were fitted to examine associations of the two walkability indices and their individual components with the weight at follow-up, adjusting for baseline weight, socio-demographic variables, and spatial clustering at the level of CCD. RESULTS: The overall mean weight gain over four years was 1.5 kg. The two walkability indices were closely correlated (r = 0.76, p < 0.01). No significant associations were found between the overall neighbourhood walkability indices and weight change. Among walkability components, there was a marginally significant negative association between space syntax measure of street integration and weight change: one standard deviation increment in street integration was associated with 0.31 kg less weight gain (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Using a prospective study design and a novel space-syntax based measure of walkability, we were not able to identify relationships between neighbourhood walkability with weight gain. This is consistent with other inconclusive findings on the built environment and obesity. Research on the built environment and adults' weight gain may need to consider not just local environments but also a larger scale environment within a city or workplace environment in order to capture multiple behaviours relevant to weight gain."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12966-018-0668-2,Adult",Australia,Censuses,Cities,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Environment Design,Exercise,

Digitalizing mental health could alleviate the burden. Still, although the corporate-driven Metaverse is expanding rapidly, there needs to be more momentum in harnessing virtual reality exposure therapy uptake. Objective: This study aims to conceptualize, develop, and deploy a free Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) application specifically designed for treating acrophobia and claustrophobia. This pilot study, which holds the promise of a future where mental health is more accessible and effective, explores the feasibility of leveraging transdisciplinary collaboration among specialists to create a safe, accessible, and effective VRET solution. Methods: We conducted a Delphi heuristic approach involving bioethicists, neuroscientists, and tech developers. Second, we reviewed the existing psychological theories and therapeutic strategies for addressing phobias in VR. Third, we conceptualized a thematic analysis-derived framework for a safe, adaptive-gamified free exposure to virtual reality acrophobia and claustrophobia (SAFEvR ACT). Finally, we provide an overview of the iterative improvements made during 12 workshops and 76 weekly briefings on developmental implementations. Results: We developed the SAFEvR ACT into a proof-of-concept application freely deployed on the MentalVerse app platform. Our safety-focused approach can benefit from prevalidation perspectives within future randomized control trials. Conclusions: The resulting application derived from the SAFEvR ACT framework represents a blueprint to counter the current lack of iVR mental health uptake by offering a free VRET alternative.

The integration of digital support and visualization tools is essential in this rapidly evolving field facing fast-growing data and changing clinical processes. This study addresses the gap in understanding the evolution of software and visualization needs within MTBs and evaluates the current state of digital support. Alignment between user requirements and software development is crucial to avoid waste of resources and maintain trust. METHODS: In two consecutive nationwide medical informatics projects in Germany, surveys and expert interviews were conducted as stage 1 (n = 14), stage 2 (n = 30), and stage 3 (n = 9). Surveys, via the SoSci Survey tool, covered participants' roles, working methods, and support needs. The second survey additionally addressed requirements for visualization solutions in molecular tumor boards. These aimed to understand diverse requirements for preparation, implementation, and documentation. Nine semi-structured expert interviews complemented quantitative findings through open discussion.

Many existing DR screening programs worldwide are non-digital, standalone, and deployed with grading retinal photographs by trained personnel. To integrate the screening programs, with or without artificial intelligence (AI), into hospital information systems to improve their effectiveness, the non-digital workflow must be transformed into digital. We developed a cloud-based digital platform and implemented it in an existing DR screening program. METHODS: We conducted the following processes in the platform for prospective DR screening at a community hospital: capturing patients' retinal photographs, uploading them for grading by AI or trained personnel on alternate weeks for 32 weeks, and referring vision-threatening DR to a referral center. At this center, the platform was applied for the assessment of potential missed referrals via remote over-reading by a retinal specialist and tracking referrals. Implementational outcomes, such as detecting positive cases, agreement between AI and over-reading, and referral adherence were assessed. RESULTS: Of 645 patients screened by AI, 201 (31.2%) were referrals, 129 (64.2%) of which were true positives agreeable by over-reading"," 115 of these true positives (89.1%) had referral adherence. False negatives judged by over-reading were 1.1% (5/444). Of 730 patients in manual screening, 175 (24.0%) were potential referrals, 11 (6.3%) of which were referred at the point-of-screening", eight of these (72.7%) adhered to referral. The remaining 164 cases were appointed for later examination by a visiting general ophthalmologist," 11 of these 116 examined (9.5%) were referred for non-DR-related eye conditions with 81.8% (9/11) referral adherence. No system failure or interruption was found. CONCLUSIONS: The digital platform can be practically integrated into the existing non-digital DR screening programs to implement AI and monitor previously unknown but important indicators, such as referral adherence, to improve the effectiveness of the programs.

It is a species of economic importance since it is farmed and used for culinary purposes. However, the genomic tools that would allow a thorough insight into the ecology, evolution, nutritional and medical properties of this highly adaptable organism, are missing. In this work, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques we assessed a significant portion of the transcriptome of this non-model organism. RESULTS: Out of the 9445 de novo assembled contigs, 2886 (30.6%) returned significant hits and for 2261 (24%) of them Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated to the hits were retrieved. A high percentage of the contigs (69.4%) produced no BLASTx hits. The GO terms were grouped to reflect biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. Certain GO terms were dominant in all groups. After scanning the assembled transcriptome for microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, SSRs), a total of 563 SSRs were recovered. Among the identified SSRs, trinucleotide repeats were the predominant followed by tetranucleotide and dinucleotide repeats. CONCLUSION: The annotation success of the transcriptome of C. aspersum was relatively low. This is probably due to the very limited number of annotated reference genomes existing for mollusc species, especially terrestrial ones. Several biological processes being active in the aestivating species were revealed through the association of the transcripts to enzymes relating to the pathways.

It causes a significant prolongation of hospital stays, leading to an increased economic and infrastructural burden on the healthcare system. Thus, primary prevention will help in preventing recurrent ADRs. People are often unable to state whether they have suffered an ADR from a medicine or not. The patients also find it difficult to recall the offending drug. They seldom seem to carry any information that would warn others of their reactions. Thus, there was a need to introduce the ADR Alert Card. A pilot study was first conducted in 2018 to assess the feasibility of this card. All patients suffering from an ADR were thus provided an alert card. Following its implementation, there was a general acceptability regarding the potential of this card in ADR recurrence prevention among healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, there is a need to assess the effectiveness of this card for ADR recurrence prevention. Objective This study aims to estimate the percentage of people who have shown the ADR Alert Card to their HCPs and benefited from it. Methods This was a prospective observational study, which was conducted at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Pune, from November 2022 to May 2024 and received approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) before its initiation. All the patients who faced an ADR were given an ADR Alert Card by their HCP. All the patients to whom their HCP had given the card were part of this study. Any patient who suffered an ADR due to overdosage of medication was excluded from the study. After screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, the data were analyzed using MS Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). A questionnaire was validated by professors in pharmacology, medicine, and community medicine. The patients were contacted through telephone conversations and provided with this questionnaire. They were asked questions regarding the ease of carrying the card, the benefit it provided them, whether they had shown it to their HCP, whether it helped them in an emergency, and their willingness to link it digitally. Their responses were recorded in Google Forms, and pie charts were generated. Results All 110 patients (100%) agreed that the ADR Alert Card was beneficial. Most (99, 90%) patients had shown the card to their HCP at their subsequent visit. The card helped 107 (97%) patients to describe their medical history easily. All the patients (110, 100%) agreed that carrying the card was easy, and most patients (95, 86%) agreed to recommend using the card to others. Additionally, most patients (79, 72%) were willing to link their card to their National Health ID. However, a small proportion of patients (28, ~25%) were skeptical whether they would link the card to the National Health ID or not. The card had helped 28 (25%) patients in an emergency. Approximately 11 (10%) patients had reported an ADR to the regulatory authority. Conclusion The patients welcomed this new concept to be inculcated in their daily lives as an effective means to enhance their healthcare. This study evaluates the number of patients who actually benefitted from using this card. It encourages patients to participate actively in their own healthcare. In an emergency situation, it proves to be a source of important health information.

More significantly, it is currently unknown how classifier choices and trends generalize across multiple institutions, due to heterogeneous acquisition and intensity characteristics (especially when considering MR imaging data). In this work, we empirically evaluate and compare a number of different classifiers and classifier ensembles in a multi-site setting, for voxel-wise detection of prostate cancer (PCa) using radiomic texture features derived from high-resolution in vivo T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. METHODS: Twelve different supervised classifier schemes: Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), naïve Bayes, Decision Trees (DTs), and their ensemble variants (bagging, boosting), were compared in terms of classification accuracy as well as execution time. Our study utilized 85 prostate cancer T2w MRI datasets acquired from across 3 different institutions (1 for discovery, 2 for independent validation), from patients who later underwent radical prostatectomy. Surrogate ground truth for disease extent on MRI was established by expert annotation of pre-operative MRI through spatial correlation with corresponding ex vivo whole-mount histology sections. Classifier accuracy in detecting PCa extent on MRI on a per-voxel basis was evaluated via area under the ROC curve. RESULTS: The boosted DT classifier yielded the highest cross-validated AUC (= 0.744) for detecting PCa in the discovery cohort. However, in independent validation, the boosted QDA classifier was identified as the most accurate and robust for voxel-wise detection of PCa extent (AUCs of 0.735, 0.683, 0.768 across the 3 sites). The next most accurate and robust classifier was the single QDA classifier, which also enjoyed the advantage of significantly lower computation times compared to any of the other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results therefore suggest that simpler classifiers (such as QDA and its ensemble variants) may be more robust, accurate, and efficient for prostate cancer CAD problems, especially in the context of multi-site validation."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12880-019-0308-6,""Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted",Discriminant Analysis,Humans,Interatrial Block,Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods,Male,"Pattern Recognition, Automated",Prostate/*pathology,

Recent advances in the concept of 'digital phenotype', which refers to the capture of characteristics of a psychiatric disorder by computerized measurement tools, is one paradigmatic example. Objective: The impact of the new technologies on health professionals practice in PTSD care remains to be determined. The recent evolutions could disrupt the clinical practices and practitioners in their beliefs, ethics and representations, going as far as questioning their professional culture. In the present paper, we conducted an extensive search to highlight the articles which reflect the potential of these new technologies.

Conclusions: This overview shows that many studies are underway allowing researchers to start building a PTSD digital phenotype using passive data obtained by biometric sensors. Active data obtained from Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) could allow clinicians to assess PTSD patients. The place of connected objects, Artificial Intelligence and remote monitoring of patients with psychiatric pathology remains to be defined.

A multi-omics analysis was employed to access alterations in gut microbiota, fecal and colonic metabolites profiles, and intestinal mRNA expression post-irradiation. The function of significant metabolite was validated at both cellular levels and organismal levels. Additionally, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq techniques were utilized to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the actions of key metabolite. RESULTS: Exposure to Y90 resulted in intestinal damage and hematological impairment. Multi-omics analysis revealed significant alternations of gut microbiota, fecal metabolites, colonic metabolites, and intestinal mRNA expression following internal radiation exposure. Notably, L-citrulline was identified as a metabolite with changes observed in both fecal and colonic tissues, demonstrating radioprotective properties in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, L-citrulline facilitated the citrullination of histone H3 at the 17th site (H3Cit17), and multiple mRNAs including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (Cxcl3), were transcriptionally regulated by H3Cit17 post L-citrulline treatment. Furthermore, Cxcl3 conferred protective effects for intestinal epithelial cells against ionizing radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The research offers critical perspectives on the intestinal and gut microbiota's reaction to radionuclides exposure. It underscores the promise of L-citrulline as a radioprotective compound, which may have substantial ramifications for the formulation of strategies to mitigate radiation exposure."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12967-025-06197-9,""Animals",*Citrulline/metabolism,*Histones/metabolism,*Radiation-Protective Agents/pharmacology,*Gastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects/radiation effects,"Mice, Inbred C57BL",Mice,Male,

DESIGN: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, thematic analysis and constant-comparison approach. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven healthcare providers and one non-clinical volunteer working in community or hospital-based settings who had experience of migrants accessing NHS England services.

While impact evaluations are important, there is a paucity of research into the more nuanced roles intervention and social network factors may play in achieving intervention outcomes, making it difficult to understand how different aspects of the intervention worked (or did not). This study applied aspects of diffusion of innovations theory to explore how SASA!, a community mobilisation approach for preventing HIV and violence against women, diffused within intervention communities and the factors that influenced the uptake of new ideas and behaviours around intimate partner relationships and violence. METHODS: This paper is based on a qualitative study of couples living in SASA communities and secondary analysis of endline quantitative data collected as part of a cluster randomised control trial designed to evaluate the impact of the SASA! INTERVENTION: The primary trial was conducted in eight communities in Kampala, Uganda between 2007 and 2012. The secondary analysis of follow up survey data used multivariate logistic regression to examine associations between intervention exposure and interpersonal communication, and relationship change (n = 928). The qualitative study used in-depth interviews (n = 20) and framework analysis methods to explore the intervention attributes that facilitated engagement with the intervention and uptake of new ideas and behaviours in intimate relationships. RESULTS: We found communication materials and mid media channels generated awareness and knowledge, while the concurrent influence from interpersonal communication with community-based change agents and social network members more frequently facilitated changes in behaviour. The results indicate combining community mobilisation components, programme content that reflects peoples' lives and direct support through local change agents can facilitate diffusion and powerful collective change processes in communities.

The downstream analysis of RNA binding sites has encouraged the investigation of novel sequence motifs, which resulted in exceptional new challenges for identifying motifs from very short sequences (e.g., small non-coding RNAs or truncated messenger RNAs), where conventional methods tend to be ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose a novel motif-finding method and validate it on a wide range of RNA applications. RESULTS: We first perform motif analysis on microRNAs and longer RNA fragments from various cellular and exosomal sources, and then validate our prediction through literature search and experimental test. For example, a 4 bp-long motif, GUUG, was detected to be responsible for microRNA loading in exosomes involved in human colon cancer (SW620). Additional performance comparisons in various case studies have shown that this new approach outperforms several existing state-of-the-art methods in detecting motifs with exceptional high coverage and explicitness. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we have demonstrated the promising performance of a new motif discovery approach that is particularly effective in current RNA applications. Important discoveries resulting from this work include the identification of possible RNA-loading motifs in a variety of exosomes, as well as novel insights in sequence features of RNA cargos, i.e., short non-coding RNAs and messenger RNAs may share similar loading mechanism into exosomes.

Instead, the data are constrained to an arbitrary """"library size"""" by the sequencing depth of the assay, and typically must be normalized prior to statistical analysis. The constrained nature of these data means one could alternatively use a log-ratio transformation in lieu of normalization, as often done when testing for differential abundance (DA) of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in 16S rRNA data. Therefore, we benchmark how well the ALDEx2 package, a transformation-based DA tool, detects differential expression in high-throughput RNA-sequencing data (RNA-Seq), compared to conventional RNA-Seq methods such as edgeR and DESeq2. RESULTS: To evaluate the performance of log-ratio transformation-based tools, we apply the ALDEx2 package to two simulated, and two real, RNA-Seq data sets. One of the latter was previously used to benchmark dozens of conventional RNA-Seq differential expression methods, enabling us to directly compare transformation-based approaches. We show that ALDEx2, widely used in meta-genomics research, identifies differentially expressed genes (and transcripts) from RNA-Seq data with high precision and, given sufficient sample sizes, high recall too (regardless of the alignment and quantification procedure used). Although we show that the choice in log-ratio transformation can affect performance, ALDEx2 has high precision (i.e., few false positives) across all transformations. Finally, we present a novel, iterative log-ratio transformation (now implemented in ALDEx2) that further improves performance in simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that log-ratio transformation-based methods can work to measure differential expression from RNA-Seq data, provided that certain assumptions are met. Moreover, these methods have very high precision (i.e., few false positives) in simulations and perform well on real data too. With previously demonstrated applicability to 16S rRNA data, ALDEx2 can thus serve as a single tool for data from multiple sequencing modalities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2261-8,""Base Sequence",*Benchmarking,Computer Simulation,"Databases, Genetic",Gene Expression Profiling/*methods,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,Humans,"RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism",

Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. METHODS: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. FINDINGS: The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990"," in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94·0 deaths (95% UI 89·2-100·0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1-290·7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1-211·4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48·1 deaths [47·4-48·8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3-37·2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8·3 years (6·7-9·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. INTERPRETATION: Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

Previous studies have shown that mismatches between the single guide RNA (sgRNA) and genomic DNA may negatively impact sgRNA efficiencies and lead to imprecise specificity prediction. Hence, the genetic variations bring about a great challenge for designing platinum sgRNAs in large human populations. However, they also provide a promising entry for designing allele-specific sgRNAs for the treatment of each individual. The CRISPR system is rather specific, with the potential ability to discriminate between similar alleles, even based on a single nucleotide difference. Genetic variants contribute to the discrimination capabilities, once they generate a novel protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site or locate in the seed region near an available PAM. Therefore, it can be leveraged to establish allele-specific targeting in numerous dominant human disorders, by selectively ablating the deleterious alleles. So far, allele-specific CRISPR has been increasingly implemented not only in treating dominantly inherited diseases, but also in research areas such as genome imprinting, haploinsufficiency, spatiotemporal loci imaging and immunocompatible manipulations. In this review, we will describe the working principles of allele-specific genome manipulations by virtue of expanding engineering tools of CRISPR. And then we will review new advances in the versatile applications of allele-specific CRISPR targeting in treating human genetic diseases, as well as in a series of other interesting research areas.

Considerable variation in available IPV-related healthcare services exists and interventions are needed to improve the quality of these services. One way to prioritize intervention efforts is by examining the level of services provided in communities most at risk relative to local incidence or prevalence of IPV. To inform future interventions, this study examined the spatial relationship between IPV-related healthcare services and IPV arrests in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and identified predictors of the observed spatial mismatch. METHODS: Survey data collected in 2014 from 278 health facilities pertaining to IPV services were geocoded, computed into a density layer, and aggregated at the census tract level to create a population-based normalized comprehensiveness score (NCS) as a proxy for IPV-related healthcare resources. IPV arrests from 2011 to 2015, collected from the county court, were geocoded and summarized by census tracts to serve as a proxy for IPV prevalence. These measures were combined into a resource disparity score (RDS) that compared relative service density to relative arrest rates, where positive RDS represented over-resourced neighborhoods and negative RDS corresponded to under-resourced neighborhoods. We used correlation analyses and a two-phase spatial modeling approach to evaluate correlates of NCS and RDS. RESULTS: A spatial lag model did not yield an association between NCS and IPV arrests, demonstrating a spatial mismatch, which we visualized using a Geographic Information System (GIS). A spatial error model revealed that the percentage of white non-Hispanic residents was positively associated with RDS, while percent black non-Hispanic, median age, ethnic heterogeneity, and economic disadvantage were negatively associated with RDS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to further evaluate the adequacy of IPV-related healthcare resources for secondary prevention relative to local IPV arrest rates, particularly within economically disadvantaged neighborhoods.

We sought to understand the information-sharing preferences of former ICU patients and their family members and to identify predictors of information-sharing preferences. DESIGN: We performed an internet survey that was developed by a broad, multidisciplinary team of stakeholders. Formal pilot testing of the survey was conducted prior to internet survey administration to study subjects. SETTING: Internet survey. SUBJECTS: Subjects included English-speaking adults who had an ICU experience or a family member with ICU experience between 2013 and 2016. We used panel sampling to ensure an ethnically representative sample of the U.S. population. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One thousand five hundred twenty surveys were submitted, and 1,470 were included in analysis.

The majority (79%) would also want their designated family member to be able to access that information from a home computer. Although most respondents preferred to share all types of information, they indicated varying levels of willingness to share specific types of more sensitive information. Information-sharing preferences did not differ by age, sex, ethnicity, or type of prior experience in the ICU (i.e., patient or family member).

For these scenarios, synchronous visualization of more than one distinct network is an excellent mean to explore all the relevant networks efficiently. In addition, complementary analysis methods are needed and they should work in a workflow manner in order to gain maximal biological insights. RESULTS: In order to address the aforementioned needs, we have developed a Synchronous Network Data Integration (SyNDI) framework. This framework contains SyncVis, a Cytoscape application for user-friendly synchronous and simultaneous visualization of multiple biological networks, and it is seamlessly integrated with other bioinformatics tools via the Galaxy platform. We demonstrated the functionality and usability of the framework with three biological examples - we analyzed the distinct connectivity of plasma metabolites in networks associated with high or low latent cardiovascular disease risk", deeper insights were obtained from a few similar inflammatory response pathways in Staphylococcus aureus infection common to human and mouse," and regulatory motifs which have not been reported associated with transcriptional adaptations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our SyNDI framework couples synchronous network visualization seamlessly with additional bioinformatics tools. The user can easily tailor the framework for his/her needs by adding new tools and datasets to the Galaxy platform."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2426-5,""Algorithms",Animals,Computational Biology/*methods,"*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial",*Gene Regulatory Networks,Humans,

While curative gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection is the standard treatment, sarcopenia and perioperative skeletal muscle loss (SML) have emerged as critical prognostic factors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 198 LAGC patients who underwent curative gastrectomy. Preoperative and postoperative sarcopenia were assessed via computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the L3 level. SML was defined based on sex-specific thresholds of SMI changes (%/30 days). Prognostic significance for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia increased from 23.7% preoperatively to 33.3% postoperatively. Patients with significant muscle loss (SML) showed worse OS and DFS compared to non-SML patients (P < 0.05). SML was also associated with a higher incidence of Clavien-Dindo grade = 3a complications (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified preoperative sarcopenia (HR = 2.332, P = 0.001), postoperative sarcopenia (HR = 3.189, P = 0.011), and SML (HR = 11.231, P = 0.002) as independent risk factors for OS. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved both OS (HR = 0.532, P = 0.015) and DFS (HR = 0.587, P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Both preoperative sarcopenia and perioperative SML may negatively impact postoperative prognosis in LAGC patients, suggesting that perioperative evaluation of skeletal muscle mass may help identify high-risk surgical candidates for targeted interventions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12885-025-13674-3,""Humans",*Sarcopenia,*Stomach Neoplasms/surgery/pathology/mortality/complications,Male,Female,Middle Aged,Retrospective Studies,*Gastrectomy/adverse effects,

This study aimed to investigate whether the parameters from DECT can predict the response to induction chemotherapy in NPC patients in two centers. METHODS: This two-center retrospective study included patients diagnosed with NPC who underwent contrast-enhanced DECT between March 2019 and November 2023. The clinical and DECT-derived parameters of tumor lesions were calculated to predict the response. We employed univariate and multivariate analysis to identify significant factors. Subsequently, the clinical, DECT, and clinical-DECT nomogram models were developed using independent predictors in the training cohort and validated in the test cohort. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the models' performance. RESULTS: A total of 321 patients were included in the study, predominantly male [247 (76.9%)] with an average age of 52.04 ± 10.87 years. The training cohort (Center 1) comprised 252 patients, while the test cohort (Center 2) comprised 69 patients. Of these, 233 out of 321 patients (72.6%) were responders to induction chemotherapy. The clinical-DECT nomogram showed an AUC of 0.805 (95% CI, 0.688-0.906), outperforming both the DECT model (Extracellular volume fraction [ECVf]) (AUC, 0.706 [95% CI, 0.571-0.825]) and the clinical model (Ki67) (AUC, 0.693 [95% CI, 0.580-0.806]) in the test cohort.

Many of these models have been operationalized into malaria early warning systems (MEWSs), which provide predictions of malaria dynamics several months in advance at national and regional levels. However, MEWSs rarely produce predictions at the village-level, the operational scale of community health systems and the first point of contact for the majority of rural populations in malaria-endemic countries. METHODS: This study developed a hyper-local MEWS for use within a health-system strengthening intervention in rural Madagascar. It combined bias-corrected, village-level case notification data with remotely sensed environmental variables at spatial scales as fine as a 10 m resolution. A spatio-temporal hierarchical generalized linear regression model was trained on monthly malaria case data from 195 communities from 2017 to 2020 and evaluated via cross-validation. The model was then integrated into an automated workflow with environmental data updated monthly to create a continuously updating MEWS capable of predicting malaria cases up to three months in advance at the village-level. Predictions were transformed into indicators relevant to health system actors by estimating the quantities of medical supplies required at each health clinic and the number of cases remaining untreated at the community level. RESULTS: The statistical model was able to accurately reproduce village-level case data, performing nearly five times as well as a null model during cross-validation. The dynamic environmental variables, particularly those associated with standing water and rice field dynamics, were strongly associated with malaria incidence, allowing the model to accurately predict future incidence rates. The MEWS represented an improvement of over 50% compared to existing stock order quantification methods when applied retrospectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing an automatic, hyper-local MEWS leveraging remotely-sensed environmental data at fine spatial scales. As health system data become increasingly digitized, this method can be easily applied to other regions and be updated with near real-time health data to further increase performance."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12936-025-05266-0,""*Malaria/prevention & control",Humans,*Rural Population/statistics & numerical data,Madagascar,Forecasting,"Models, Statistical","Remote Sensing Technology"",39885540,PMC11780933",,

Ontologies provide a systematic and transparent basis for clinical case definition and can be used to identify clinical codes relevant to all aspects of CKD care and its diagnosis. METHODS: We used routinely collected primary care data from the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre. A domain ontology was created and presented in Ontology Web Language (OWL). The identification and staging of CKD was then carried out using two parallel approaches: (1) clinical coding consistent with a diagnosis of CKD"," (2) laboratory-confirmed CKD, based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or the presence of proteinuria. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised of 1.2 million individuals aged 18 years and over. 78,153 (6.4%) of the population had CKD on the basis of an eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73m(2), and a further 7366 (0.6%) individuals were identified as having CKD due to proteinuria. 19,504 (1.6%) individuals without laboratory-confirmed CKD had a clinical code consistent with the diagnosis. In addition, a subset of codes allowed for 1348 (0.1%) individuals receiving renal replacement therapy to be identified. CONCLUSIONS: Finding cases of CKD from primary care data using an ontological approach may have greater sensitivity than less comprehensive methods, particularly for identifying those receiving renal replacement therapy or with CKD stages 1 or 2.

Given the critical nature of the disease, it is paramount that individuals with diabetes undergo annual screening for early and timely detection of DR, facilitating prompt ophthalmic assessment and intervention. However, screening for DR, which involves assessing visual acuity and retinal examination through ophthalmoscopy or retinal photography, presents a significant global challenge due to the massive volume of individuals requiring annual reviews. To counter this challenge, there has been an increasing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for automated diagnosis of DR. The AI tools primarily utilize deep learning (DL) techniques and are tailored to analyse extensive medical image data and provide diagnostic outputs, essentially streamline the DR screening process. However, the development of such AI tools requires access to a comprehensive retinal image database with a plethora of high-resolution fundus images from various cameras, covering all DR lesions. Additionally, the accurate training of these AI algorithms necessitates skilled professionals, such as optometrists or ophthalmologists, to provide reliable ground truths that ensure the precision of the diagnostic outputs. To address these prerequisites, we have initiated a study involving multiple institutions to establish a large-scale online 'Retinal Image Database' in India, aiming to contribute significantly to DR research. This paper delineates the methodology employed for this significant undertaking, detailing the steps taken to create the large retinal image database, as well as the framework for developing a cost-effective, robust AI-based DR diagnostic tool. Our work is expected to mark a significant stride in DR detection and management, promising a more efficient and scalable solution for tackling this global health challenge."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41598-025-91941-w,""*Diabetic Retinopathy/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging",Humans,India,"*Databases, Factual",Retina/diagnostic imaging/pathology,Mass Screening/methods,Artificial Intelligence,Algorithms,

Of course, several studies demonstrated the 16S ribosomal RNA could be considered as a barcode for bacteria classification at the genus level, but till now it is hard to identify the correct composition of metagenomic data from RNA-seq short-read data. 16S short-read data are generated using two next generation sequencing technologies, i.e. whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon (AMP)"," typically, the former is filtered to obtain short-reads belonging to a 16S shotgun (SG), whereas the latter take into account only some specific 16S hypervariable regions. The above mentioned two sequencing technologies, SG and AMP, are used alternatively, for this reason in this work we propose a deep learning approach for taxonomic classification of metagenomic data, that can be employed for both of them. RESULTS: To test the proposed pipeline, we simulated both SG and AMP short-reads, from 1000 16S full-length sequences. Then, we adopted a k-mer representation to map sequences as vectors into a numerical space. Finally, we trained two different deep learning architecture, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep belief network (DBN), obtaining a trained model for each taxon. We tested our proposed methodology to find the best parameters configuration, and we compared our results against the classification performances provided by a reference classifier for bacteria identification, known as RDP classifier. We outperformed the RDP classifier at each taxonomic level with both architectures. For instance, at the genus level, both CNN and DBN reached 91.3% of accuracy with AMP short-reads, whereas RDP classifier obtained 83.8% with the same data. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we proposed a 16S short-read sequences classification technique based on k-mer representation and deep learning architecture, in which each taxon (from phylum to genus) generates a classification model. Experimental results confirm the proposed pipeline as a valid approach for classifying bacteria sequences"," for this reason, our approach could be integrated into the most common tools for metagenomic analysis. According to obtained results, it can be successfully used for classifying both SG and AMP data."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2182-6,""Algorithms",Bacteria/*classification/*genetics,"Databases, Genetic",*Deep Learning,*Metagenome,Metagenomics/*methods,

In case of digital planning, it can be taken over from the planning and the appliance can be produced in advance. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of these three techniques and whether there is an association with the insertion angle. METHODS: Two OMIs were digitally planned and placed in the anterior palate of 11 human cadavers with different insertion angles. Subsequently, the position of each OMI was detected by an IOS, a silicone impression, and a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan, whereby the CBCT scan was set as """"real position"""". The measurements of accuracy were performed between the CBCT data as a reference and the preoperative digital planning, the IOS and the plaster model manufactured from the silicone impression. RESULTS: The IOS was the most accurate in detecting the Top (mean deviation 0.14 mm) and the Apex (mean deviation 0.36 mm) of the OMIs. Significant linear deviations between the three modalities were registered for both Top (p < 0.001) and Apex (p = 0.010). The digital planning procedure achieved the lowest mean angular deviation of 3.7° and was significantly more accurate in this respect than the IOS (p < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, ethics-approved study included 19 symptomatic adult subjects who underwent knee MRI on a clinical 3 T scanner. Every subject was scanned with 3 DL-enhanced acquisition protocols in a single session: a clinical standard 2-fold in-plane parallel imaging (PI) accelerated 2D TSE-based protocol (5 sequences, 11 minutes 23 seconds) that served as a reference, a DL-reconstructed 4-fold accelerated 2D TSE protocol combining 2-fold PI and 2-fold simultaneous multislice acceleration (5 sequences, 6 minutes 24 seconds), and a 3D SRR protocol based on DL-enhanced 6-fold accelerated (ie, 3-fold PI and 2-fold simultaneous multislice) 2D Dixon TSE MRI (6 anisotropic 2D Dixon TSE acquisitions rotated around the phase-encoding axis, 6 minutes 24 seconds). This resulted in a total of 228 knee MRI scans comprising 21,204 images. Three readers evaluated all pseudonymized and randomized images in terms of image quality using a 5-point Likert scale. Two of the readers (musculoskeletal radiologists) additionally evaluated anatomical visibility and diagnostic confidence to assess normal and pathological knee structures with a 5-point Likert scale. They recorded the presence and location of internal knee derangements, including cartilage defects, meniscal tears, tears of ligaments, tendons and muscles, and bone injuries. The statistical analysis included nonparametric Friedman tests, and interreader and intrareader agreement assessment using the weighted Fleiss-Cohen kappa (?) statistic. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The evaluated DL-enhanced 4-fold accelerated 2D TSE protocol provided very similar image quality and anatomical visibility to the standard 2D TSE protocol, whereas the 3D SRR Dixon TSE protocol scored less in terms of overall image quality due to reduced edge sharpness and the presence of artifacts ( P < 0.001). Subjective signal-to-noise ratio, contrast resolution, fluid brightness, and fat suppression were good to excellent for all protocols. For 1 reader, the Dixon method of the 3D SRR protocol provided significantly better fat suppression than the spectral fat saturation applied in the standard 2D TSE protocol ( P < 0.05). The visualization of knee structures with 3D SRR Dixon TSE was very similar to the standard protocol, except for cartilage, tendons, and bone, which were affected by the presence of reconstruction and aliasing artifacts ( P < 0.001). The diagnostic confidence of both readers was high for all protocols and all knee structures, except for cartilage and tendons. The standard 2D TSE protocol showed a significantly higher diagnostic confidence for assessing tendons than 3D SRR Dixon TSE MRI ( P < 0.01). The interreader and intrareader agreement for the assessment of internal knee derangements using any of the 3 protocols was substantial to almost perfect (? = 0.67-1.00). For cartilage, the interreader agreement was substantial for DL-enhanced accelerated 2D TSE (? = 0.79) and almost perfect for standard 2D TSE (? = 0.98) and 3D SRR Dixon TSE (? = 0.87). For menisci, the interreader agreement was substantial for 3D SRR Dixon TSE (? = 0.70-0.80) and substantial to almost perfect for standard 2D TSE (? = 0.80-0.99) and DL-enhanced 2D TSE (? = 0.87-1.00). Moreover, the total acquisition time was reduced by 44% when using the DL-enhanced accelerated 2D TSE or 3D SRR Dixon TSE protocol instead of the conventional 2D TSE protocol. CONCLUSIONS: The presented DL-enhanced 4-fold accelerated 2D TSE protocol provides image quality and diagnostic performance similar to the standard 2D protocol. Moreover, the 3D SRR of DL-enhanced 6-fold accelerated 2D Dixon TSE MRI is feasible for multicontrast 3D knee MRI as its diagnostic performance is comparable to standard 2-fold accelerated 2D knee MRI. However, reconstruction and aliasing artifacts need to be further addressed to guarantee a more reliable visualization and assessment of cartilage, tendons, and bone. Both the 2D and 3D SRR DL-enhanced protocols enable a 44% faster examination compared with conventional 2-fold accelerated routine 2D TSE knee MRI and thus open new paths for more efficient clinical 2D and 3D knee MRI."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1097/RLI.0000000000001118,""Humans",*Deep Learning,*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods,Male,Prospective Studies,Female,"*Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods",*Knee Joint/diagnostic imaging,

Digital consent addresses some of these limitations. However, limited research has been conducted to understand relative costs and consequences associated with adopting digital consent pathways. The aim of this study was to compare the relative costs of digital consent pathways with paper-based consent pathways in UK National Health Service (NHS) clinical practice. METHOD: A micro-costing study was conducted from the UK NHS perspective. Multi-stakeholder involvement contributed to understanding how the paper-based consent pathway varies by department and hospital setting. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the key cost drivers and scenario analyses explored the effect of consent timing and hospital digital readiness. Potential advantages and disadvantages of digital consent were also considered, such as possible impacts associated with consent-related litigation. RESULTS: The cost per consent episode is approximately £0.90 more expensive when completed on paper. The ordering or printing of paper consent forms, and the transportation of forms to storage and back to clinic are process steps that would not be necessary with digital consent. Sensitivity and scenario analyses indicated consultation duration had the greatest impact on the relative costs of both pathways. Per litigation claim prevented, an average of £201,590 could be saved. CONCLUSIONS: Digital consent is potentially cost saving for the NHS. Consent for elective procedures is recommended in advance of the day of surgery, and digital consent used in this scenario demonstrated the greatest savings.

This paper argues that efforts to develop responsible digital health practices could benefit from paying closer attention to a different branch of medical ethics, namely public health ethics. In particular, I argue that the influential """"accountability for reasonableness"""" (A4R) approach to public health ethics can help overcome some of the limitations of existing digital ethics principles. A4R seeks to resolve trade-offs through decision-procedures designed according to certain shared procedural values. This allows stakeholders to recognize decisions reached through these procedures as legitimate, despite their underlying disagreements. I discuss the prospects for adapting A4R to the context of responsible digital health and suggest questions for further research."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Janaina""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fdgth.2021.690417,"""",34713166,PMC8521828",,,,,,,,

In this technique, the global and regional T(1) are measured manually by drawing region of interest in motion-corrected T(1) maps. The manual analysis contributes to an already lengthy CMR analysis workflow and impacts measurements reproducibility. In this study, we propose an automated method for combined myocardium segmentation, alignment, and T(1) calculation for myocardial T(1) mapping. METHODS: A deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) was used for myocardium segmentation in T(1) weighted images. The segmented myocardium was then resampled on a polar grid, whose origin is located at the center-of-mass of the segmented myocardium. Myocardium T(1) maps were reconstructed from the resampled T(1) weighted images using curve fitting. The FCN was trained and tested using manually segmented images for 210 patients (5 slices, 11 inversion times per patient). An additional image dataset for 455 patients (5 slices and 11 inversion times per patient), analyzed by an expert reader using a semi-automatic tool, was used to validate the automatically calculated global and regional T(1) values. Bland-Altman analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient, r, and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) were used to evaluate the performance of the FCN-based analysis on per-patient and per-slice basis. Inter-observer variability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the T(1) values calculated by the FCN-based automatic method and two readers. RESULTS: The FCN achieved fast segmentation (< 0.3 s/image) with high DSC (0.85 ± 0.07). The automatically and manually calculated T(1) values (1091 ± 59 ms and 1089 ± 59 ms, respectively) were highly correlated in per-patient (r = 0.82", slope = 1.01, p < 0.0001) and per-slice (r = 0.72, slope = 1.01," p < 0.0001) analyses. Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the automated and manual measurements with 95% of measurements within the limits-of-agreement in both per-patient and per-slice analyses. The intraclass correllation of the T(1) calculations by the automatic method vs reader 1 and reader 2 was respectively 0.86/0.56 and 0.74/0.49 in the per-patient/per-slice analyses, which were comparable to that between two expert readers (=0.72/0.58 in per-patient/per-slice analyses). CONCLUSION: The proposed FCN-based image processing platform allows fast and automatic analysis of myocardial native T(1) mapping images mitigating the burden and observer-related variability of manual analysis."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12968-018-0516-1,""Adult",Aged,Automation,Cardiovascular Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology,

By investigating the abundance associations of species or genes, we can construct molecular ecological networks (MENs). The MENs are often constructed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between genes. In this work, we also applied multimodal mutual information (MMI) to construct MENs. The members which drive the concerned MENs are referred to as key drivers. RESULTS: We proposed a novel method to detect the key drivers. First, we partitioned the MEN into subnetworks. Then we identified the most pertinent subnetworks to the disease by measuring the correlation between the abundance pattern and the delegated phenotype-the variable representing the disease phenotypes. Last, for each identified subnetwork, we detected the key driver by PageRank. We developed a package named KDiamend and applied it to the gut and oral microbial data to detect key drivers for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). We detected six T2D-relevant subnetworks and three key drivers of them are related to the carbohydrate metabolic process. In addition, we detected nine subnetworks related to RA, a disease caused by compromised immune systems. The extracted subnetworks include InterPro matches (IPRs) concerned with immunoglobulin, Sporulation, biofilm, Flaviviruses, bacteriophage, etc., while the development of biofilms is regarded as one of the drivers of persistent infections.

When the research is performed on the basis of patient consent, traditional study-specific consent appears too cumbersome for many researchers. Alternative models of consent are currently being discussed and introduced in different contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study explores stakeholder perspectives on ethical, legal, and practical concerns regarding models of consent for health data research at German university medical centers. METHODS: Semistructured focus group interviews were conducted with medical researchers at German university medical centers, health IT specialists, data protection officers, and patient representatives. The interviews were analyzed using a software-supported structuring qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Stakeholders regarded broad consent to be only marginally less laborious to implement and manage than tiered consent. Patient representatives favored specific consent, with tiered consent as a possible alternative. All stakeholders lamented that information material was difficult to understand. Oral information and videos were mentioned as a means of improvement. Patient representatives doubted that researchers had a sufficient degree of data security expertise to act as sole information providers. They were afraid of undue pressure if obtaining health data research consent were part of medical appointments. IT specialists and other stakeholders regarded the withdrawal of consent to be a major challenge and called for digital consent management solutions. On the one hand, the transfer of health data to non-European countries and for-profit organizations is seen as a necessity for research. On the other hand, there are data security concerns with regard to these actors. Research without consent is legally possible under certain conditions but deemed problematic by all stakeholder groups, albeit for differing reasons and to different degrees. CONCLUSIONS: More efforts should be made to determine which options of choice should be included in health data research consent. Digital tools could improve patient information and facilitate consent management. A unified and strict regulation for research without consent is required at the national and European Union level. Obtaining consent for health data research should be independent of medical appointments, and additional personnel should be trained in data security to provide information on health data research."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/52180,Humans",*Informed Consent/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence,*Qualitative Research,Focus Groups,Germany,Interviews as Topic,"Computer Security,39110970,PMC11339564",,

The diagnosis or problem list is an important feature of the electronic health record, which provides a dynamic account of a patient's current illness and past history. In the case of an Austrian hospital network, problem list entries are limited to fifty characters and are potentially linked to ICD-10. The requirement of producing ICD codes at each hospital stay, together with the length limitation of list items leads to highly redundant problem lists, which conflicts with the physicians' need of getting a good overview of a patient in short time. This paper investigates a method, by which problem list items can be semantically grouped, in order to allow for fast navigation through patient-related topic spaces. METHODS: We applied a minimal language-dependent preprocessing strategy and mapped problem list entries as tf-idf weighted character 3-grams into a numerical vector space. Based on this representation we used the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering algorithm with cosine distances and inferred an optimal boundary in order to form semantically consistent topic spaces, taking into consideration different levels of dimensionality reduction via latent semantic analysis (LSA). RESULTS: With the proposed clustering approach, evaluated via an intra- and inter-patient scenario in combination with a natural language pipeline, we achieved an average compression rate of 80% of the initial list items forming consistent semantic topic spaces with an F-measure greater than 0.80 in both cases. The average number of identified topics in the intra-patient case (µ(Intra) = 78.4) was slightly lower than in the inter-patient case (µ(Inter) = 83.4). LSA-based feature space reduction had no significant positive performance impact in our investigations. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation presented here is centered on a data-driven solution to the known problem of information overload, which causes ineffective human-computer interactions at clinicians' work places. This problem is addressed by navigable disease topic spaces where related items are grouped and the topics can be more easily accessed."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-019-0789-9,Austria",*Cluster Analysis,Data Management/*methods,*Electronic Health Records,Humans,International Classification of Diseases,Semantics,"User-Computer Interface,30943968,PMC6448176",

The increase in use of RNA-seq technology has led to the continuous development of new tools for every step of analysis from alignment to downstream pathway analysis. However, effectively using these analysis tools in a scalable and reproducible way can be challenging, especially for non-experts. RESULTS: Using the workflow management system Snakemake we have developed a user friendly, fast, efficient, and comprehensive pipeline for RNA-seq analysis. VIPER (Visualization Pipeline for RNA-seq analysis) is an analysis workflow that combines some of the most popular tools to take RNA-seq analysis from raw sequencing data, through alignment and quality control, into downstream differential expression and pathway analysis. VIPER has been created in a modular fashion to allow for the rapid incorporation of new tools to expand the capabilities. This capacity has already been exploited to include very recently developed tools that explore immune infiltrate and T-cell CDR (Complementarity-Determining Regions) reconstruction abilities. The pipeline has been conveniently packaged such that minimal computational skills are required to download and install the dozens of software packages that VIPER uses.

However, 30-40% of these trials fail mainly because such studies have inadequate sample sizes, stemming from the inability to obtain accurate initial estimates of average treatment effect parameters. METHODS: To remove this obstacle from the drug development cycle, we present a new algorithm called Trend-Adaptive Design with a Synthetic-Intervention-Based Estimator (TAD-SIE) that powers a parallel-group trial, a standard RCT design, by leveraging a state-of-the-art hypothesis testing strategy and a novel trend-adaptive design (TAD). Specifically, TAD-SIE uses synthetic intervention (SI) to estimate individual treatment effects and thereby simulate a cross-over design, which makes it easier for a trial to reach target power within trial constraints (e.g., sample size limits). To estimate sample sizes, TAD-SIE implements a new TAD tailored to SI given that using it violates assumptions under standard TADs. In addition, our TAD overcomes the ineffectiveness of standard TADs by allowing sample sizes to be increased across iterations without any condition while controlling significance level with futility stopping. Our TAD also introduces a hyperparameter that enables trial designers to trade off between accuracy and efficiency (sample size and number of iterations) of the solution. RESULTS: On a real-world Phase-3 clinical RCT (i.e., a two-arm parallel-group superiority trial with an equal number of subjects per arm), TAD-SIE obtains operating points ranging between 63% to 84% power and 3% to 6% significance level in contrast to baseline algorithms that get at best 49% power and 6% significance level. CONCLUSION: TAD-SIE is a superior TAD that can be used to reach typical target operating points but only for trials with rapidly measurable primary outcomes due to its sequential nature. The framework is useful to practitioners interested in leveraging the SI algorithm for their study design."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13063-024-08661-1,""Sample Size",Humans,*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods,"*Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/methods",*Algorithms,*Research Design,Computer Simulation,"Data Interpretation, Statistical",

The causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, is a highly virulent bacterium, however the molecular mechanisms underlying T. pallidum pathogenesis remain to be definitively identified. This is due to the fact that T. pallidum is currently uncultivatable, inherently fragile and thus difficult to work with, and phylogenetically distinct with no conventional virulence factor homologs found in other pathogens. In fact, approximately 30% of its predicted protein-coding genes have no known orthologs or assigned functions. Here we employed a structural bioinformatics approach using Phyre2-based tertiary structure modeling to improve our understanding of T. pallidum protein function on a proteome-wide scale. RESULTS: Phyre2-based tertiary structure modeling generated high-confidence predictions for 80% of the T. pallidum proteome (780/978 predicted proteins). Tertiary structure modeling also inferred the same function as primary structure-based annotations from genome sequencing pipelines for 525/605 proteins (87%), which represents 54% (525/978) of all T. pallidum proteins. Of the 175 T. pallidum proteins modeled with high confidence that were not assigned functions in the previously annotated published proteome, 167 (95%) were able to be assigned predicted functions. Twenty-one of the 175 hypothetical proteins modeled with high confidence were also predicted to exhibit significant structural similarity with proteins experimentally confirmed to be required for virulence in other pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Phyre2-based structural modeling is a powerful bioinformatics tool that has provided insight into the potential structure and function of the majority of T. pallidum proteins and helped validate the primary structure-based annotation of more than 50% of all T. pallidum proteins with high confidence.

Similar patient portals have been adopted in different formats and with variable levels of success. In this longitudinal study (2021-2023) we examined how the NHS App became implemented in the pandemic context and beyond. METHODS: We recruited 88 participants in 62 qualitative interviews and four focus groups. Participants included patients, carers, members of the public, clinical/non-clinical NHS staff from five GP practices (where we also conducted over 60 h of observations) across England, as well as other industry, policy and civil rights stakeholders. Document analysis also contributed to participant recruitment and data interpretation. Data collection and analysis was informed by the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Our study identified the various ways in which complexity manifested as part of the implementation, use and roll-out of the NHS App. Patients had diverse (positive and negative) user experiences as the app evolved, with some of its features described as more useful than others (e.g. prescription ordering, COVID Pass). As the app primarily provided a gateway to general practice systems and infrastructures, not all features were available by default or consistently to all users, with information often appearing fragmented or system-facing (e.g. coded). NHS staff viewed the app as constituting core NHS infrastructure in the long term which made it appealing, even though initially there was less recognition of its immediate value. There was variable organisational capacity to enable implementation and to put in place processes and staff roles required to support patient adoption. Shifting emphasis towards in-person care, challenges with digital inclusion and controversies related to features such as patient access to own records further complicated roll-out.

Calcifications of left-sided heart valves are also markers of CVD risk. We investigated whether air pollution was associated with valvular calcification and its progression. METHODS: We studied 6253 MESA participants aged 45-84 years who underwent two cardiac CT scans 2.5 years apart to quantify aortic valve calcium (AVC) and mitral annular calcium (MAC). CAC was included for the same timeframe for comparison with AVC/MAC.

While biological sex (p(biologicalsex)) and class level (p(classlevel)) influenced the choice of sources (p(biologicalsex)=0.011", p(classlevel):0.0001) and the factors determining this choice (p(biologicalsex)=0.011-0.022," p(classlevel)=0.0001-0.005), topic preferences were only influenced by class level (p(biologicalsex)>0.05"," pclasslevel = 0.0001-0.022). CONCLUSION: DPR students should be supported with reliable and up-to-date social media-based digital content prepared by experts in the field about physiotherapy practice and with easy access to scientific data, even in the late stages of pandemic processes such as COVID-19, when the need for access to information is high due to their professional role."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12909-025-06764-0,""Humans",*COVID-19/epidemiology,Male,Female,Cross-Sectional Studies,

RESULTS: The combined """"prevalence"""" of the investigated MSK (diagnosis between 2000 and 2016) among adults attending Australian general practice was 16.8% (95%CI 15.9",17.7) with 21.3% (95%CI 20.2,"22.4) of the sample consulting for chronic pain between 2013 and 2016. The investigated MSK with the highest """"prevalence"""" were arthritis (9.5%) and chronic back pain (6.7%).

Information systems are necessary for community health volunteer programs to be effective, yet effectiveness evaluations of such information systems implemented at scale are rare. In October 2010, a network of female volunteers with little or no literacy, the Women's Development Army (WDA), was added to extend Ethiopia's Health Extension Program services to every household in the community. Between July 2013 and January 2015, a health management information system for the WDA's Community-Based Data for Decision-Making (CBDDM) strategy was implemented in 115 rural districts to improve the demand for and utilization of maternal and newborn health services. Using the CBDDM strategy, Health Extension Workers (HEWs) fostered the WDA and community leaders to inform, lead, own, plan, and monitor the maternal and newborn health interventions in their kebeles (communities). This paper examines the effectiveness of the CBDDM strategy. METHODS: Using data from cross-sectional surveys in 2010-11 and 2014-15 from 177 kebeles, we estimated self-reported maternal and newborn care practices from women with children aged 0 to 11 months (2124 at baseline and 2113 at follow-up), and a CBDDM implementation strength score in each kebele. Using kebele-level random-effects models, we assessed dose-response relationships between changes over time in implementation strength score and changes in maternal and newborn care practices between the two surveys. RESULTS: Kebeles with relatively high increases in CBDDM implementation strength score had larger improvements in the coverage of neonatal tetanus-protected childbirths, institutional deliveries, clean cord care for newborns, thermal care for newborns, and immediate initiation of breastfeeding. However, there was no evidence of any effect of the intervention on postnatal care within 2 days of childbirth. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the extent to which an information system for community health volunteers with low literacy was implemented at scale, and evidence of effectiveness at scale in improving maternal and newborn health care behaviors and practices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12884-018-1976-x,""Adolescent",Adult,Clinical Decision-Making/*methods,Cross-Sectional Studies,Ethiopia,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Health Care Surveys,

This framework will incorporate both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering methods to present more understandable and accurate diagnostic results. The method entails several steps with CNN models: ADa-22 and AD-22, transformer networks, and an SVM classifier, all inbuilt. The CVC ClinicDB dataset supports this process, containing 1650 colonoscopy images classified as polyps or non-polyps. The best performance in the ensembles was done by the AD-22  Transformer  SVM model, with an AUC of 0.99, a training accuracy of 99.50%, and a testing accuracy of 99.00%. This group also saw a high accuracy of 97.50% for Polyps and 99.30% for Non-Polyps, together with a recall of 97.80% for Polyps and 98.90% for Non-Polyps, hence performing very well in identifying both cancerous and healthy regions. The framework proposed here uses K-means clustering in combination with the visualisation of bounding boxes, thereby improving segmentation and yielding a silhouette score of 0.73 with the best cluster configuration. It discusses how to combine feature interpretation challenges into medical imaging for accurate localization and precise segmentation of malignant regions. A good balance between performance and generalization shall be done by hyperparameter optimization-heavy learning rates"," dropout rates and overfitting shall be suppressed effectively. The hybrid schema of this work treats the deficiencies of the previous approaches, such as incorporating CNN-based effective feature extraction, Transformer networks for developing attention mechanisms, and finally the fine decision boundary of the support vector machine. Further, we refine this process via unsupervised clustering for the purpose of enhancing the visualisation of such a procedure. Such a holistic framework, hence, further boosts classification and segmentation results by generating understandable outcomes for more rigorous benchmarking of detecting colorectal cancer and with higher reality towards clinical application feasibility."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41598-025-86590-y,""Humans",*Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis,*Unsupervised Machine Learning,*Supervised Machine Learning,Colonoscopy/methods,Cluster Analysis,Colonic Polyps/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging,

Data were collected through an online survey from August 1 to August 31, 2020. The TAM was extended by incorporating innovation, social, and organizational characteristics. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between constructs, including perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), and intention to use e-learning. The findings revealed that PEU and PU were pivotal in shaping e-learning acceptance, underscoring the need for user-friendly and effective platforms. Attitude toward e-learning significantly influenced participants' intention to use e-learning platforms, with PEU emerging as the most influential factor. PU had a more substantial impact on faculty members and undergraduate students, while postgraduates placed less emphasis on usefulness. Organizational factors only indirectly affected e-learning acceptance, mediated by individual characteristics. This study underscores the importance of usability, technological infrastructure, and digital literacy training in promoting e-learning acceptance among health professions students and faculty members.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are crucial components of TME, yet their role in SCLC and the underlying mechanisms during their interaction with SCLC cells remain to be determined. METHODS: Microenvironmental cell components were estimated using transcriptome data from SCLC tissue available in public databases, analyzed with bioinformatic algorithms. A co-culture system comprising MRC5 fibroblasts and SCLC cell lines was constructed. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on co-cultured and separately cultured MRC5 and H196 cells to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched signaling pathways. Glycolysis and STING signaling in SCLC cells were assessed using glucose uptake assays, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of SCLC tissue arrays quantified a-SMA, HLA-DRA and CD8 expression. RESULTS: Non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) SCLC-derived CAFs exhibited more abundance and DEGs than NE SCLC-derived CAFs did, which interact with non-NE SCLC cells can induce the enrichment of glycolysis-related genes, increasement of glucose uptake, upregulation of glycolytic signaling proteins in non-NE SCLC cells and accumulation of lactate in the extracellular environment, confirming CAF-mediated glycolysis promotion. Additionally, glycolysis-induced ATP production activated STING signaling in non-NE SCLC cells, which upregulated T cell chemo-attractants. However, CAF abundance did not correlate with CD8  T cell numbers in SCLC tissues. Additionally, non-NE SCLC cell-educated CAFs exhibited features of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), as indicated by the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Co-localization of HLA-DRA and a-SMA signals in SCLC tissues confirmed apCAF presence. The apCAFs and CD8  T cells were co-located in the SCLC stroma, and there was a positive correlation between CAFs and regulatory T cell (Treg) abundance. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that crosstalk between CAFs and non-NE SCLC cells promotes glycolysis in non-NE SCLC cells, thereby increase T cell chemo-attractant expression via activating STING signaling. On the other hand, it promotes the presence of apCAFs, which probably contributes to CD8  T cell trapping and Treg differentiation. This study emphasizes the pro-tumor function of CAFs in SCLC by promoting glycolysis and impairing T cell function, providing direction for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting CAF in SCLC."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s10020-024-01051-y,""Humans",*Glycolysis,*Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/metabolism,*Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/metabolism/pathology/genetics,*Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/genetics/immunology,*Tumor Microenvironment,"Cell Line, Tumor","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic",

Most can track either cardiac or respiratory motion, and many incur some overhead to imaging data acquisition. We previously described a Cartesian cine imaging technique, pseudo-projection motion tracking with golden-step phase encoding, capable of tracking both cardiac and respiratory motion at no cost to imaging data acquisition. In this work, we describe improvements to the technique by dramatically reducing its vulnerability to eddy current and flow artifacts and demonstrating its effectiveness in expanded cardiovascular applications. METHODS: As with our previous golden-step technique, the Cartesian phase encodes over time were arranged based on the integer golden step, and readouts near k(y) = 0 (pseudo-projections) were used to derive motion. In this work, however, the readouts were divided into equal and consecutive temporal segments, within which the readouts were sorted according to k(y). The sorting reduces the phase encode jump between consecutive readouts while maintaining the pseudo-randomness of k(y) to sample both cardiac and respiratory motion without comprising the ability to retrospectively set the temporal resolution of the original technique. On human volunteers, free-breathing, electrocardiographic (ECG)-free cine scans were acquired for all slices of the short axis stack and the 4-chamber view of the long axis. Retrospectively, cardiac motion and respiratory motion were automatically extracted from the pseudo-projections to guide cine reconstruction. The resultant image quality in terms of sharpness and cardiac functional metrics was compared against breath-hold ECG-gated reference cines. RESULTS: With sorting, motion tracking of both cardiac and respiratory motion was effective for all slices orientations imaged, and artifact occurrence due to eddy current and flow was efficiently eliminated. The image sharpness derived from the self-gated cines was found to be comparable to the reference cines (mean difference less than 0.05 mm(- 1) for short-axis images and 0.075 mm(- 1) for long-axis images), and the functional metrics (mean difference < 4 ml) were found not to be statistically different from those from the reference. CONCLUSIONS: This technique dramatically reduced the eddy current and flow artifacts while preserving the ability of cost-free motion tracking and the flexibility of choosing arbitrary navigator zone width, number of cardiac phases, and duration of scanning. With the restriction of the artifacts removed, the Cartesian golden-step cine imaging can now be applied to cardiac imaging slices of more diverse orientation and anatomy at greater reliability."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12968-019-0533-8,""Adult",*Artifacts,*Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques,Female,Healthy Volunteers,*Heart Rate,Heart Ventricles/*diagnostic imaging,Humans,

RESULTS: We implemented PreOptique, a novel hybrid semantic and text-based system that was commissioned by a large hospital in Norway for providing integrated access to patient health records scattered over several databases and document repositories. We use ontology-based data access (OBDA) for the seamless integration of the structured databases at the hospital through the Optique platform. We employ text analysis techniques to extract vital sign measures and clinical findings from patient documents. PreOptique was developed and deployed at the hospital. This solution demonstrates how OBDA technology can provide integrated data access to disparate structured sources in healthcare, without requiring the replacement of existing databases. Unstructured clinical texts are also mined to extract patient findings, while the graphical user interface (GUI) provides a single access point that hides the underlying complexity of the system.

RESULTS: SES, education and household net-income were lower in the group of persons with PHQ-2 = 2 at baseline, and they predicted the occurrence of PHQ-2 = 2 at 2.5 year follow-up in the group of persons without elevated depressive symptoms at baseline after multivariable adjustment (SES: Odds Ratio (OR) 0.96, 0.95-0.98, p <  0.0001"," education: OR 0.96, 0.93-0.99, p = 0.036"," household net-income: OR 0.96, 0.92-0.99, p = 0.046) but not in the group of persons with elevated depressive symptoms at baseline. Further, we found that the impact of major medical diseases on the development of elevated depressive symptoms was buffered by high income. In addition, living in a partnership buffered the impact of a low occupational position. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding the SES, the dimensions education and household net-income seem to play the most important role for socioeconomic inequalities in persons in Mid-West Germany with depressive symptoms.

This study examines whether the cumulative size distribution of LAA clusters, defined with thresholds of the 15th, 25th, and 35th percentiles of a CT density histogram instead of the fixed-threshold of - 950 HU, exhibits a fractal property and whether its fractal dimension (D'15, D'25, and D'35, respectively) provides additional structural information in emphysematous lungs that is difficult to detect with the conventional - 950-HU-based fractal dimension (D950). METHODS: Chest inspiratory CT scans and pulmonary functions were cross-sectionally examined in 170 COPD subjects. A proxy for the inspiration level at CT scan was obtained by dividing CT-measured total lung volume (CT-TLV) by physiologically measured total lung capacity. Moreover, long-term (> 5 years) changes in D950 and the new fractal dimensions were longitudinally evaluated in 17 current and 42 former smokers with COPD. RESULTS: D950, but not D'15, D'25, or D'35 was weakly correlated with the proxy for the inspiration. D950, D'25, and D'35 but not D'15 correlated with LAA% and diffusion capacity. In the long-term longitudinal study, LAA% was increased and D950 and D'35 were decreased in both current and former smokers, while D'25 was decreased only in current smokers and D'15 was not changed in either group. The longitudinal changes in D'25 but not those in LAA%, D950, D'15, and D'35 were greater in current smokers than in former smokers. This greater change in D'25 in current smokers was confirmed after adjusting the change in CT-TLV and the baseline D'25. CONCLUSIONS: D'25 reflects diffusion capacity in emphysematous lungs and is robust against inspiration levels during CT scans. This new fractal dimension might provide additional structural information that is difficult to detect with the conventional D950 and LAA% and allow for more sensitive evaluation of emphysema progression over time."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12890-018-0714-5,""Aged",Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Fractals,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Lung/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology,Male,

Despite existing evidence linking behavioural impairment to caregiver distress, the role of cognitive impairment remains less clear, with mixed findings on its impact. METHODS: This study assessed the influence of cognitive and behavioural impairments in people with ALS on the distress of their nominated informants. The data were collected face-to-face and remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cognitive and behavioural impairments were measured using established screening tools. Informants' distress was evaluated through composite measures of burden, anxiety, and depression. Regression analyses were employed to determine the predictive value of cognitive and behavioural impairment on informant distress. RESULTS: A total of 98 ALS patients and 84 informants participated. Behavioural impairment predicted informant distress across various tools. In contrast, cognitive impairment was a less consistent predictor of informant distress across screening measures and did not significantly interact with behavioural impairment in predicting distress. Administration mode did not affect predictive relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioural impairment in ALS significantly predicts informant distress, with varying predictive power across different screening tools. Cognitive impairment also affects informant distress, but its impact is less substantial compared to behavioural factors.

Here we introduce decontam ( https://github.com/benjjneb/decontam ), an open-source R package that implements a statistical classification procedure that identifies contaminants in MGS data based on two widely reproduced patterns: contaminants appear at higher frequencies in low-concentration samples and are often found in negative controls. RESULTS: Decontam classified amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in a human oral dataset consistently with prior microscopic observations of the microbial taxa inhabiting that environment and previous reports of contaminant taxa. In metagenomics and marker-gene measurements of a dilution series, decontam substantially reduced technical variation arising from different sequencing protocols. The application of decontam to two recently published datasets corroborated and extended their conclusions that little evidence existed for an indigenous placenta microbiome and that some low-frequency taxa seemingly associated with preterm birth were contaminants. CONCLUSIONS: Decontam improves the quality of metagenomic and marker-gene sequencing by identifying and removing contaminant DNA sequences.

Our prior study identified that a patient decision aid, RealRisks, improved patient-reported outcomes (including worry and perceived risk) relative to standard educational materials. This study examined patients' GT experience and its influence on subsequent actions. We also sought to identify areas for improvement in RealRisks that would expand its focus from improved GT decision-making to understanding results. METHODS: Women enrolled in the parent randomized controlled trial were recruited and interviewed. Demographic data was collected from surveys in the parent study. Interviews were conducted, transcribed, and coded to identify recurring themes. Descriptive statistics were generated to compare the interviewed subgroup to the original study cohort of 187 women. RESULTS: Of the 22 women interviewed, 11 (50%) had positive GT results, 2 (9.1%) with a BRCA1/2 PV, and 9 (40.9%) with variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Median age was 40.5 years and 15 (71.4%) identified as non-Hispanic. Twenty (90.9%) reported a family history of BC, and 2 (9.1%) reported a family history of BRCA1/2 PV. The emerging themes included a preference for structured communication of GT results and the need for more actionable knowledge to mitigate BC risk, especially among patients with VUS or negative results. Few patients reported lifestyle changes following the return of their results, although they did understand that their behaviors can impact their BC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Patients preferred a structured explanation of their GT results to facilitate a more personal testing experience. While most did not change lifestyle behaviors in response to their GT results, there was a consistent call for further guidance following the initial discussion of GT results. Empowering patients, especially those with negative or VUS results, with the context to internalize the implications of their results and form accurate risk perception represents a powerful opportunity to optimize subsequent risk management strategies.

During the CAD-CAM prosthesis delivery process, clinicians often need to make adjustments to the prosthesis to avoid occlusal interferences that may occur during lateral excursions. Recently, there have been developments in the field of mandibular motion tracking using optical devices. These approaches seek to incorporate an individual's functional movement into the research field of occlusal morphology. AIM: This study aimed to assess the accuracy of digitally replicating mandibular movements to identify and correct occlusal interferences in monolithic CAD-CAM zirconia crowns. METHODS: An intraoral scanner (IOS) was used to capture complete arch maxillary and mandibular teeth and record buccal and lateral interocclusal records of maxillary first premolar abutment teeth of thirteen participants. For each patient, two monolithic zirconia crowns were fabricated following the standard digital workflow. The crowns were categorized based on the virtual method used for adjusting occlusal interferences into two groups: Group I, where occlusal interferences in CAD-CAM zirconia crowns were adjusted using buccal interocclusal records, and Group II, where adjustments were made using both buccal and lateral interocclusal records. After crown fabrication following the manufacturer's instructions, occlusion was analyzed using an electronic pressure analyzer. The mean, standard deviation and median values of the recorded data were measured. Paired t test and Wilcoxon Sign Rank test were executed for analyzing differences between groups (p value = 0.05). RESULTS: Group I recorded higher maximum pressure at lateral mandibular movement with mean ± standard deviation value of 26.00 ± 4.95% than Group II with 20.62 ± 3.38%. Regarding pressure recorded at maximum intercuspation (MI) Group I showed higher results"," 8.08 ± 1.50% compared to Group II with 7.23 ± 1.59% mean ± standard deviation value.

However, even though the outer wall of the airways is connected with lung parenchyma and the mechanical properties of the parenchyma affect the behaviour of the airways, little is known about the interactions between airway and lung sizes on lung function and symptoms. The present study examined these effects by establishing a novel computed tomography (CT) index, namely, airway volume percent (AWV%), which was defined as a percentage ratio of the airway tree to lung volume. METHODS: Inspiratory chest CT, pulmonary function, and COPD Assessment Tests (CAT) were analysed in 147 stable males with COPD. The whole airway tree was automatically segmented, and the percentage ratio of the airway tree volume in the right upper and middle-lower lobes to right lung volume was calculated as the AWV% for right lung. Low attenuation volume % (LAV%), total airway count (TAC), luminal area (Ai), and wall area percent (WA%) were also measured. RESULTS: AWV% decreased as the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) spirometric grade increased (p < 0.0001). AWV% was lower in symptomatic (CAT score = 10) subjects than in non-symptomatic subjects (p = 0.036). AWV% was more closely correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC) than Ai, Ai to lung volume ratio, and volume of either the lung or the airway tree. Multivariate analyses showed that lower AWV% was associated with lower FEV(1) and higher RV/TLC, independent of LAV%, WA%, and TAC. CONCLUSIONS: A disproportionally small airway tree with a relatively large lung could lead to airflow obstruction and gas trapping in COPD. AWV% is an easily measured CT biomarker that may elucidate the clinical impacts of the airway-lung interaction in COPD."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12931-019-1047-5,""Aged

However, there are very few experimental studies on the signaling cross-talks between bacteria and human host to date. METHODS: In this work, taking M. tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) that is co-evolving with its human host as an example, we propose a general computational framework that exploits the known bacterial pathogen protein interaction networks in STRING database to predict pathogen-host protein interactions and their signaling cross-talks. In this framework, significant interlogs are derived from the known pathogen protein interaction networks to train a predictive l(2)-regularized logistic regression model. RESULTS: The computational results show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance of cross validation as well as low predicted positive rates on the less significant interlogs and non-interlogs, indicating a low risk of false discovery. We further conduct gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses of the predicted pathogen-host protein interaction networks, which potentially provides insights into the machinery that M. tuberculosis H37Rv targets human genes and signaling pathways. In addition, we analyse the pathogen-host protein interactions related to drug resistance, inhibition of which potentially provides an alternative solution to M. tuberculosis H37Rv drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed machine learning framework has been verified effective for predicting bacteria-host protein interactions via known bacterial protein interaction networks. For a vast majority of bacterial pathogens that lacks experimental studies of bacteria-host protein interactions, this framework is supposed to achieve a general-purpose applicability.

METHODS: We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize changes in the epithelial state and tissue microenvironment associated with CAG. The molecular changes were identified by comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two mucosa states. Gene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analysis was used to explore the potential functional changes in each cell subtype in atrophic mucosa. Gene set score analysis was conducted to compare the functional roles of different fibroblast subtypes and functional changes in cell subtypes between the CAG and control groups. Metabolic analysis was performed to compare the metabolic activity of C1Q() macrophages under different conditions. NichNet analysis was used to analyze the regulatory relationships between CCL11()APOE() fibroblasts and C1Q() macrophages and between CCL11()APOE() fibroblasts and CD8() effector T cells. Transcription factor (TF) analysis was performed to determine the transcription status of different T-cell subtypes in atrophic and normal mucosa. RESULTS: We generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from 3 CAG biopsy samples and paired adjacent normal tissues. Our analysis revealed that chief cells and parietal cells exhibited a loss of detoxification ability and that surface mucous cells displayed a reduced antimicrobial defense ability in CAG lesions. The mucous neck cells in CAG lesions showed upregulation of genes related to cell cycle transition, which may lead to aberrant DNA replication. Additionally, cells with the T exhaustion phenotype infiltrated under CAG condition. C1Q() macrophages exhibited reduced phagocytosis, downregulated expression of pattern recognition receptors and decreased metabolic activity. NichNet analysis revealed that a subpopulation of CXCL11()APOE() fibroblasts regulated the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of atrophic gastritis. APSN()CXCL11()APOE() fibroblasts were found to be associated with gastric cancer (GC) development. CONCLUSIONS: The main goal of this study was to comprehensively elucidate the cellular changes in CAG lesions. We observed an immune decline in the mucosal microenvironment during the development of CAG, including a reduced immune response of C1Q() macrophages, reduced cytotoxicity of T cells, and increased infiltration of exhausted T cells. Specifically, we demonstrated that different epithelial subtypes aberrantly express genes related to susceptibility to external bacterial infection and aberrant cell cycle progression.

In recent years, NQRs have also been recognised as an area where patients can be involved, contributing with self-reported experiences and estimations of health effects. This study aimed to investigate what the registry management perceived as barriers and facilitators for the use of NQRs in QI, research, and interaction with patients, and main activities undertaken to enhance their use for these purposes. The aim was further to identify potential differences between various types of NQRs for their use in these areas. METHODS: In this multiple case study, nine NQRs were purposively selected. Interviews (n = 18) were conducted and analysed iteratively using conventional and directed content analysis. RESULTS: A recent national investment initiative enabled more intensive work with development areas previously identified by the NQR management teams. The recent focus on value-based health care and other contemporary national healthcare investments aiming at QI and public benchmarking were perceived as facilitating factors. Having to perform double registrations due to shortcomings in digital systems was perceived as a barrier, as was the lack of authority on behalf of the registry management to request participation in NQRs and QI activities based on registry outcomes. The registry management teams used three strategies to enhance the use of NQRs: ensuring registering of correct and complete data, ensuring updated and understandable information available for patients, clinicians, researchers and others stakeholders, and intensifying cooperation with them. Varied characteristics of the NQRs influenced their use, and the possibility to reach various end-users was connected to the focus area and context of the NQRs. CONCLUSIONS: The recent national investment initiative contributed to already ongoing work to strengthen the use of NQRs. To further increase the use, the demands of stakeholders and end-users must be in focus, but also an understanding of the NQRs' various characteristics and challenges.

However, information-provision is particularly challenging in an oncology setting. It is therefore imperative to help oncological health care practitioners (HCP) optimise their information-giving skills. New forms of online education, i.e. e-learning, enable safe and time and location independent ways of learning, enhancing access to continuous learning for HCP. As part of a user-centred approach to developing an e-learning to improve information-giving skills, this study aims to: 1) uncover the learning needs of oncological healthcare providers related to information- provision, and 2) explore their training preferences in the context of clinical practice. METHODS: Focus groups and interviews were organised with oncological HCP (medical specialists and clinical nurse specialists) addressing participants' learning needs concerning information- provision and their training preferences with respect to a new digital training tool on this issue. All sessions were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Using an inductive approach, transcripts were independently coded by three researchers and discussed to reach consensus. Main themes were summarised and discussed. RESULTS: Four focus group sessions (total n = 13) and three interviews were conducted. The first theme concerned the patient outcomes HCP try to achieve with their information. We found HCP to mainly strive to promote patients' understanding of information. The second theme concerned HCP reported strategies and challenges when trying to inform their patients. These entailed tailoring of information to patient characteristics, structuring of information, and dealing with patients' emotions. Regarding HCP training preferences, an e-learning should be neatly connected to clinical practice. Moreover, participants desired a digital training to allow for feedback on their own (videotaped) information-giving skills from peers, communication experts, and/or patients"," to monitor their progress and to tailored the training to individual learning needs. CONCLUSIONS: An e-learning for improvement of information-giving skills of oncological HCP should be aimed at the transfer of skills to clinical practice, rather than at enhancing knowledge. Moreover, an e-learning is probably most effective when the facilitates individual learning needs, supports feedback on competence level and improvement, and allows input from significant others (experts, peers, or patients)."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12909-018-1308-x,""Attitude of Health Personnel",*Clinical Competence,*Communication,"*Education, Distance",Focus Groups,Humans,Interviews as Topic,*Stakeholder Participation

In most national jurisdictions (e.g., in Europe), this type of secondary use requires patient consent. While various ethical, legal, and technical analyses have stressed the opportunities and challenges for different types of consent over the past decade, no country has yet established a national consent standard accepted by the relevant authorities. METHODS: A working group of the national Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany conducted a requirements analysis and developed a GDPR-compliant broad consent standard. The development included consensus procedures within the Medical Informatics Initiative, a documented consultation process with all relevant stakeholder groups and authorities, and the ultimate submission for approval via the national data protection authorities. RESULTS: This paper presents the broad consent text together with a guidance document on mandatory safeguards for broad consent implementation. The mandatory safeguards comprise i) independent review of individual research projects, ii) organizational measures to protect patients from involuntary disclosure of protected information, and iii) comprehensive information for patients and public transparency. This paper further describes the key issues discussed with the relevant authorities, especially the position on additional or alternative consent approaches such as dynamic consent. DISCUSSION: Both the resulting broad consent text and the national consensus process are relevant for similar activities internationally. A key challenge of aligning consent documents with the various stakeholders was explaining and justifying the decision to use broad consent and the decision against using alternative models such as dynamic consent. Public transparency for all secondary use projects and their results emerged as a key factor in this justification. While currently largely limited to academic medicine in Germany, the first steps for extending this broad consent approach to wider areas of application, including smaller institutions and medical practices, are currently under consideration."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104096,*Biomedical Research",Computer Security,Delivery of Health Care,Europe,Humans,"Informed Consent,35643273,",,,

By law, registration in the GBR is mandatory, with data primarily transferred from medical records (MRs) by designated personnel at medical facilities. We aimed to assess the correspondence of the registration of selected variables between GBR and MRs. METHODS: We randomly selected 1,044 women who gave birth in 2018. Data were extracted from the GBR on 27 variables related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the newborn and individually linked to the MRs. We specifically compared the agreement of dichotomous, ordinal, and date variables between the GBR and the MRs to assess the consistency of individual registrations. RESULTS: Of the 27 dichotomous, ordinal, and date variables, 22 displayed more than 95% complete agreement with the information in the MRs. The prevalence of maternal morbidity registered in the MRs was lower than expected, while the proportion of fetuses with transverse lies was higher than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Most antenatal, intrapartum, and newborn information registered in the GBR has satisfactory agreement with the MRs, with error typical for single data entry system. The lower-than-expected prevalence of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, hypertensive disorders, and postpartum hemorrhage registered in the MRs, as well as the higher-than-expected prevalence of transverse fetal presentation, warrants in-depth investigation to ensure that the quality of care is satisfactory and to further improve registration in both the MRs and GBR.

While people often want to be involved in making decisions about their health, there are many challenges. People with advanced illness may have limited or wavering ability to participate fully in decision-making conversations - or lack decisional capacity for making decisions. Additionally, they may have a limited understanding of CPR and tend to receive inconsistent information on the process and outcome of CPR. Unfortunately, these discussions are often avoided. Shared decision-making approaches are an approach to overcoming these challenges. The objectives of this research was to design, test, and analyze a novel CPR video decision aid (VDA) with nephrology patients and their families in a clinical setting. METHODS: The Interprofessional Shared Decision-making Model was used as a framework to guide the research. A prospective quasi-experimental design included pre/posttest measures of knowledge and confidence in decision-making, and posttest only measure of uncertainty about the decision. RESULTS: Participant knowledge about CPR increased from a mean score of 4.8/9 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.65) before viewing the video to 7.5/9 (SD = 1.40) (p = 0.000) after viewing the video. Decisional self-efficacy improved slightly from 84% pre intervention (SD 17.04, range 20-100) to 86% after the intervention (SD 14.13, range 39-100) (p = 0.005) for patient participants. Before the intervention, most patients (43/49", 86%) had an order to have CPR in the physician orders and very few (7/49," 14%) had an order not to have CPR. Immediately after viewing the CPR-VDA and completing the values clarification worksheet, fewer 28/49 (57%) chose to have CPR, 13 (27%) chose not to have CPR and 8 (16%) were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: The CPR-VDA was feasible and acceptable to patients with ESRD, their families and the healthcare team. The CPR-VDA positively affected decision-making: improving patient and family knowledge about CPR, clarity of values, patients' decisional self-efficacy, the congruence between documented physician's orders and patient choice, quality of communication about CPR, while reducing decisional conflict (uncertainty) amongst patients, families, and physicians."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12882-018-1018-y,""Aged","Aged, 80 and over",Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*methods/psychology/standards,Clinical Decision-Making/*methods,*Decision Support Techniques,Feasibility Studies,

The argumentative-analytical approach is based on four established principles of medical ethics (following Beauchamp and Childress), namely autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, as well as on the Model Professional Code of Conduct for Physicians working in Germany (MBO-Ä). RESULTS: When prescribing DHAs, physicians need to give patients additional information on the specific risks that result from such applications. Special attention must be paid to patients' digital health literacy. Furthermore, DHAs should not replace personal contact, but complement and support guideline-based treatment. To enable patients to use DHAs more independently, we recommend an 'app anamnesis'.

Four independent deep learning models for diagnosis of pneumothorax were trained and evaluated on two external datasets. Results reveal that HE enhancement significantly affects model performance, particularly in terms of generalizability. Models trained solely on HE-enhanced datasets exhibit poorer performance on external validation sets, suggesting potential overfitting and information loss. These models also exhibit shortcut learning, relying on spurious correlations in the training data for their prediction. This study highlights the importance of machine learning practitioners being aware of preprocessing techniques applied to datasets and their potential impacts on model performance, as well as need for including preprocessing information when sharing datasets.

Current literature supports using co-design to improve service quality and create more satisfactory services. However, while the 'why' of using co-design is well understood, there is limited literature on 'how' to co-design. We aimed to describe the application of co-design from start to finish within a specific case study and to reflect on the challenges and benefits created by specific process design choices. METHODS: A telepractice re-design project has been a case study example of co-design. The co-design was co-facilitated by an embedded researcher and a peer researcher with lived experience of disability. Embedded in a Western Australian disability organisation, the co-design process included five workshops and a reflection session with a team of 10 lived experience and staff participants (referred to as co-designers) to produce a prototype telepractice model for testing. RESULTS: The findings are divided into two components. The first describes the process design choices made throughout the co-design implementation case study. This is followed by a reflection on the benefits and challenges resulting from specific process design choices. The reflective process describes the co-designers' perspective and the researcher's and organisational experiences. Reflections of the co-designers include balancing idealism and realism, the value of small groups, ensuring accessibility and choice, and learning new skills and gaining new insights. The organisational and research-focused reflections included challenges between time for building relationships and the schedules of academic and organisational decision-making, the messiness of co-design juxtaposed with the processes of ethics applications, and the need for inclusive dissemination of findings. CONCLUSIONS: The authors advocate that co-design is a useful and outcome-generating methodology that proactively enables the inclusion of people with disability and service providers through community-based participatory research and action. Through our experiences, we recommend community-based participatory research, specifically co-design, to generate creative thinking and service design."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40900-024-00573-3,"""",38730283,PMC11084036",,,,,,,,

As patients entering a doctor's practice can potentially infect medical staff and other patients, using digital alternatives wherever possible is a potential solution to avoiding face-to-face encounters. In these conditions, telemedicine is becoming increasingly relevant. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine telemedicine use and gathered experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In June 2020, a representative group of Austrian respondents (n = 1000) was asked via online survey whether they had contacted a doctor during spring of 2020, and, if so, whether they had used a telemedical method to do so. The survey also reflected gathered experiences and degrees of satisfaction with the use of telemedicine. RESULTS: A third (33%) of those who contacted a doctor during the target period did so using telemedical tools. The majority of those with previous telehealth experience were satisfied with the help they received. Patients commonly used a telephone to contact their doctors. The overall assessment of telemedical aids tended to be positive, with more than half (53%) of those surveyed seeing significant advantages, and a 90% satisfaction rate among the respondents who used telehealth services. CONCLUSION: The outcomes from this work hint at fairly high acceptance of telemedical communication tools in the studied group of the Austrian population. Based on the high rate of satisfaction among patients who used telehealth, it is expected that the use of telehealth services will increase further in the near future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3390/healthcare9030280,"""",33806673,PMC8001477",,,,,,,,

Here, entrepreneurial visions and claims of how neurotechnology innovation will revolutionize society-from brain-computer-interfaces to neural enhancement and cognitive phenotyping-are confronted with public and policy concerns about the risks and ethical challenges related to such innovations. But while neuroethics frameworks have a longer track record in public sector research such as the U.S. BRAIN Initiative, much less is known about how businesses-and especially start-ups-address ethics in tech development. In this paper, we investigate how actors in the field frame and enact ethics as part of their innovative R&D processes and business models. Drawing on an empirical case study on direct-to-consumer (DTC) neurotechnology start-ups, we find that actors engage in careful boundary-work to anticipate and address public critique of their technologies, which allows them to delineate a manageable scope of their ethics integration. In particular, boundaries are drawn around four areas: the technology's actual capability, purpose, safety and evidence-base. By drawing such lines of demarcation, we suggest that start-ups make their visions of ethical neurotechnology in society more acceptable, plausible and desirable, favoring their innovations while at the same time assigning discrete responsibilities for ethics. These visions establish a link from the present into the future, mobilizing the latter as promissory place where a technology's benefits will materialize and to which certain ethical issues can be deferred. In turn, the present is constructed as a moment in which ethical engagement could be delegated to permissive regulatory standards and scientific authority. Our empirical tracing of the construction of 'ethical realities' in and by start-ups offers new inroads for ethics research and governance in tech industries beyond neurotechnology."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11948-022-00421-1,*Technology",*Biotechnology/ethics,*Neurobiology/ethics,"*Industry/ethics,36729246,PMC9894989",,,,,

However, their integration into clinical workflows requires rigorous evaluation to ensure reliability, safety, and ethical alignment. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review examines the evaluation parameters and methodologies applied to LLMs in clinical medicine, highlighting their capabilities, limitations, and application trends. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv databases, encompassing both peer-reviewed and preprint studies. Studies were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify original research evaluating LLM performance in medical contexts. RESULTS: The results reveal a growing interest in leveraging LLM tools in clinical settings, with 761 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. While general-domain LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and GPT-4, dominated evaluations (93.55%), medical-domain LLMs accounted for only 6.45%. Accuracy emerged as the most commonly assessed parameter (21.78%). Despite these advancements, the evidence base highlights certain limitations and biases across the included studies, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation and robust evaluation frameworks.

AI tools with high accuracy, especially those that detect asymptomatic cases, may be hindered by barriers to adoption. Understanding provider needs and concerns is critical to inform implementation strategies that improve provider buy-in and adoption of AI tools in medicine. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe provider perspectives on the adoption of an AI-enabled screening tool in primary care to inform effective integration and sustained use. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 as part of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial at a large academic medical center in the United States. In all, 29 primary care providers were purposively sampled using a positive deviance approach for participation in semistructured focus groups after their use of the AI tool in the randomized controlled trial was complete. Focus group data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach"," iterative analysis was conducted to identify codes and themes, which were synthesized into findings. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that providers understood the purpose and functionality of the AI tool and saw potential value for more accurate and faster diagnoses. However, successful adoption into routine patient care requires the smooth integration of the tool with clinical decision-making and existing workflow to address provider needs and preferences during implementation. To fulfill the AI tool's promise of clinical value, providers identified areas for improvement including integration with clinical decision-making, cost-effectiveness and resource allocation, provider training, workflow integration, care pathway coordination, and provider-patient communication. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of AI-enabled tools in medicine can benefit from sensitivity to the nuanced context of care and provider needs to enable the useful adoption of AI tools at the point of care.

The government has taken active measures to address persistent mental health challenges and provide better care by exploring innovative digital solutions. Several e-health services initiatives have been implemented, including electronic health record systems, telemedicine services, e-appointment systems, and mobile health applications. However, the adoption of e-health technologies in Morocco, even for basic services such as the e-appointment system (EAS), remains notably low. Objective By assessing the constructs of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) along with additional variables, including trust in technology and perceived mental health conditions, this study aims to identify key predictors influencing patients' acceptance and use of EAS as a reliable way of accessing mental health support.  Methods Data were collected through a questionnaire survey administered to mental health patients receiving treatment at the Psychiatry Department of the University Hospital in Casablanca, Morocco. Patients were recruited based on their willingness to participate, while those with cognitive difficulties that impaired their ability to complete the survey were excluded. The survey was conducted over seven months, from January to July 2023, with a total of 200 participants enrolled during their visits to the University Hospital. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of EAS acceptance among mental health patients. Results The results indicate low adoption rates of the EAS, with many patients only trying it once before reverting to traditional scheduling methods, such as phone calls or in-person visits. Perceptions show optimism about the benefits of EAS but highlight areas for improvement in social and technical support to enhance acceptance. Performance expectancy, trust in technology, and facilitating conditions were found to be significant predictors of EAS acceptance and use among mental health patients. In contrast, effort expectancy, social influence, and perceived mental health conditions were insignificant and didn't appear to influence EAS acceptance meaningfully. Conclusion This study's findings can be used to develop effective strategies that promote the widespread adoption of e-mental health services and ultimately address the barriers to accessing quality mental healthcare."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.76143,"""",39835084,PMC11745419",,,,,,,,

The potential bias resulting from linkage misspecification, partial cohort follow-up, and outcome misclassification in these studies has been largely unexplored. This study integrated epidemiological survey and novel administrative data sources to establish the Alaska Longitudinal Child Abuse and Neglect Linkage (ALCANLink) project. Using these data we evaluated and quantified the impact of non-linkage misspecification and single source maltreatment ascertainment use on reported maltreatment risk and effect estimates. METHODS: The ALCANLink project integrates the 2009-2011 Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) sample with multiple administrative databases through 2014, including one novel administrative source to track out-of-state emigration. For this project we limited our analysis to the 2009 PRAMS sample. We report on the impact of linkage quality, cohort follow-up, and multisource outcome ascertainment on the incidence proportion of reported maltreatment before age 6 and hazard ratios of selected characteristics that are often available in birth cohort linkage studies of maltreatment. RESULTS: Failure to account for out-of-state emigration biased the incidence proportion by 12% (from 28.3%(w) to 25.2%(w)), and the hazard ratio (HR) by as much as 33% for some risk factors. Overly restrictive linkage parameters biased the incidence proportion downwards by 43% and the HR by as much as 27% for some factors. Multi-source linkages, on the other hand, were of little benefit for improving reported maltreatment ascertainment. CONCLUSION: Using the ALCANLink data which included a novel administrative data source, we were able to observe and quantify bias to both the incidence proportion and HR in a birth cohort linkage study of reported child maltreatment. Failure to account for out-of-state emigration and low-quality linkage methods may induce bias in longitudinal data linkage studies of child maltreatment which other researchers should be aware of. In this study multi-agency linkage did not lead to substantial increased detection of reported maltreatment. The ALCANLink methodology may be a practical approach for other states interested in developing longitudinal birth cohort linkage studies of maltreatment that requires limited resources to implement, provides comprehensive data elements, and can facilitate comparability between studies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40621-017-0119-6,"""",28762156,PMC5545181",,,,,,,,

METHODS: Statistical and mathematical models and three age-based sampling structures (survey-based structure, population-based structure, uniform structure) were used. Our calculations are based on Belgian serological survey data collected in 2001-2003 where testing was done, amongst others, for the presence of Immunoglobulin G antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella, for which a national mass immunisation programme was introduced in 1985 in Belgium, and against varicella-zoster virus and parvovirus B19 for which the endemic equilibrium assumption is tenable in Belgium.

METHODS: We design a novel concept-based filter and a prediction model to detect local recurrences using EHRs. In the training dataset, we manually review a development corpus of 50 progress notes and extract partial sentences that indicate breast cancer local recurrence. We process these partial sentences to obtain a set of Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts using MetaMap, and we call it positive concept set. We apply MetaMap on patients' progress notes and retain only the concepts that fall within the positive concept set.

However, the deployments of SAR technologies also bring ethical challenges in tandem, to the fore, especially in under-resourced contexts. While previous research has highlighted various ethical challenges that arise in SAR deployment in real-world settings, most of the research has been centered in resource-rich contexts, mainly in developed countries in the 'Global North,' and the work specifically in the educational setting is limited. This research aims to evaluate and reflect upon the potential ethical and pedagogical challenges of deploying a social robot in an under-resourced context. We base our findings on a 5-week in-the-wild user study conducted with 12 kindergarten students at an under-resourced community school in New Delhi, India. We used interaction analysis with the context of learning, education, and ethics to analyze the user study through video recordings. Our findings highlighted four primary ethical considerations that should be taken into account while deploying social robotics technologies in educational settings"," (1) language and accent as barriers in pedagogy, (2) effect of malfunctioning, (un)intended harms, (3) trust and deception, and (4) ecological viability of innovation. Overall, our paper argues for assessing the ethical and pedagogical constraints and bridging the gap between non-existent literature from such a context to evaluate better the potential use of such technologies in under-resourced contexts."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s12369-022-00882-1,"""",35637787,PMC9133315",,,,,,,

Although clinically significant, DRE can be challenging, especially for first-time patients. Reasons for refusal often include misunderstandings about the examination, fear of the way the test is done, and feelings of embarrassment. This study seeks to explore the views, opinions, and perceptions of individuals in the Western region of Saudi Arabia towards DRE. The objective is to guide interventions and improve healthcare practices related to anorectal conditions in this population. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, we used a validated questionnaire, which was translated from English into Arabic, before distributing it to the target population. The target population included adults older than 18 years residing in the Western region of Saudi Arabia. Although our initial sample size was determined to be 385, we successfully recruited a larger sample of 1,147 participants. Data were statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software for Windows, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). RESULTS: A total of 1,087 eligible participants completed the study questionnaire. Among them, 480 participants (44.2%) demonstrated a good overall awareness and understanding of DRE, while the majority, 607 (55.8%), had poor awareness. University-educated participants exhibited better awareness, with 363 (47.7%) showing good overall awareness compared to 103 (35.2%) of those with only secondary education, a statistically significant difference. Furthermore, 269 (46.7%) of students had a good awareness of DRE compared to 55 (34.8%) of unemployed participants. Notably, 218 (58.4%) of individuals working or studying in the medical field had a good awareness of DRE, compared to 207 (37.2%) in non-medical fields. CONCLUSION: The majority of individuals showed limited knowledge regarding DRE. The findings suggest increasing public understanding and raising awareness of and importance of DRE for improving healthcare outcomes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.67702,"""",39318951,PMC11420612",,,,,,,,

METHODS: A 3D-printed transfer key was designed, combining facial and intraoral (IOS) scans. The design included components that recorded the 3D upper and lower arch at centric occlusion. The virtual patient model image was generated in-vitro using a phantom head with soft tissue simulation. Accuracy was assessed by superimposing the 3D scans with reference CBCT images and analyzing trueness and precision using root mean square (RMS) deviations. RESULTS: The transfer key included an intra-oral part that acts as an anterior deprogrammer to record the relationship of two dental arches at centric occlusion (CO) and an extra-oral with a rotatable cross-shaped design with two arms for locating the facial midline and the two pupils connecting line. Superimposition demonstrated high trueness (RMS: 0.51 mm for the arch regions, 0.69 mm for the whole head region, 0.85 mm in the face region) and precision (RMS: 0.41 mm for the arch regions, 0.52 mm for the entire head, 0.63 mm in the face region) significantly (p < 0.05). Minimal deviations were observed in critical areas, including the tooth and lip position, indicating that the virtual patient model was closely aligned with the CBCT reference. The dental arches achieved the highest accuracy, while slight deviations were noted in the facial regions. CONCLUSIONS: The 3D-printed customized transfer key effectively enhanced the virtual patient model's accuracy, surpassing traditional trueness and precision methods. This novel approach offers a streamlined, patient-friendly solution for digital dental workflows."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41405-025-00303-1,"""",39890779,PMC11785937",,,,,,,,

The data obtained with different variations of this assay is typically manually processed, which has created a need for tools that would streamline and standardize processing steps. RESULTS: We present Shoelaces, a toolkit for ribosome profiling experiments automating read selection and filtering to obtain genuine translating footprints. Based on periodicity, favoring enrichment over the coding regions, it determines the read lengths corresponding to bona fide ribosome protected fragments. The specific codon under translation (P-site) is determined by automatic offset calculations resulting in sub-codon resolution. Shoelaces provides both a user-friendly graphical interface for interactive visualisation in a genome browser-like fashion and a command line interface for integration into automated pipelines. We process 79 libraries and show that studies typically discard excessive amounts of quality data in their manual analysis pipelines. CONCLUSIONS: Shoelaces streamlines ribosome profiling analysis offering automation of the processing, a range of interactive visualization features and export of the data into standard formats. Shoelaces stores all processing steps performed in an XML file that can be used by other groups to exactly reproduce the processing of a given study. We therefore anticipate that Shoelaces can aid researchers by automating what is typically performed manually and contribute to the overall reproducibility of studies.

However, patient engagement in self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring remains low despite healthcare providers' efforts. This study aimed to assess adherence and acceptance of RPM for SMBP among Texas Federally Qualified Health Center patients. METHODS: Participants enrolled in the SMBP monitoring program were recruited at three health centers. Data was collected from patient health records, and a questionnaire assessed hypertension self-management, technology acceptance, intentions, and attitudes toward SMBP. Thematic analysis was conducted for open-ended responses that followed each item, and multivariate linear regression assessed associations between psychosocial factors and SMBP use.

While prior research has primarily focused on the psychological aspects of rumors-such as the beliefs, behaviors, and persistence they evoke-there has been limited exploration of how rumors are processed in the brain. In this study, we experimented to examine both behavioral responses and EEG data during rumor detection. Participants evaluated the credibility of 80 randomly presented rumors, and only 22% were able to identify false rumors more accurately than by random chance. Our ERP findings reveal that truth judgments elicit stronger negative ERP responses (N400) compared to false judgments, while false judgments are associated with larger positive ERP responses (P2, P3, and LPP). Additionally, we identified gender differences in brain activity related to rumor detection, suggesting distinct cognitive strategies. Men demonstrated greater P2 and enhanced N400 responses, while women exhibited larger P3 and LPP amplitudes. This study is among the first to investigate the neural patterns underlying rumors recognition and to highlight gender disparities in decision-making related to rumors."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41598-024-82696-x,Humans",Male,Female,*Evoked Potentials/physiology,*Electroencephalography/methods,Young Adult,*Brain/physiology,Adult,

METHODS: This study was performed on 41 aSAH patients diagnosed by non-contrast brain CT, CT angiography, and digital subtraction angiography followed by interventional aneurysmal embolization. Patients were followed up for 20 days by clinical assessment, EEG monitoring, and transcranial duplex studies (TCD) for early detection of vasospasm and DCI. RESULTS: The most common ruptured aneurysmal sites were middle cerebral, anterior communicating, posterior communicating, terminal internal carotid, and anterior cerebral arteries respectively. The incidence of vasospasm was 36.8% of the included cases"," 57% progressed to DCI while 43% passed a spontaneous regressive course. The most common arteries undergoing vasospasm were the MCA followed by the ACA, ICA, and lastly the basilar arteries. The mean time of vasospasm development as detected by EEG monitoring and/or TCD was 8.4 ± 2.8 days which was earlier than clinical signs by 12.5 ± 5.3 h in those progressed to DCI. CONCLUSION: Continuous EEG monitoring and TCD are valuable methods for early detection of vasospasm and they allow for early therapeutic intervention before irreversible ischemic neurological deficits take place."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s41983-018-0050-y,"""",30686913,PMC6325090",,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the wider socio-economic context and conditions for such innovation processes in the Stockholm region, using the functional dynamics approach to innovation systems (ISs). Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on triangulation using data from 16 in-depth interviews, two workshops, and additional documents. Using the functional dynamics approach, critical structural and functional components of the healthcare IS were analyzed. Findings The analysis revealed several mechanisms blocking innovation processes such as fragmentation, lack of clear leadership, as well as insufficient involvement of patients and healthcare professionals. Furthermore, innovation is expected to occur linearly as a result of research. Restrictive rules for collaboration with industry, reimbursement, and procurement mechanisms limit entrepreneurial experimentation, commercialization, and spread of innovations. Research limitations/implications In this study, the authors analyzed how certain functions of the functional dynamics approach to ISs related to each other. The authors grouped knowledge creation, resource mobilization, and legitimacy as they jointly constitute conditions for needs articulation and entrepreneurial experimentation. The economic effects of entrepreneurial experimentation and needs articulation are mainly determined by the stage of market formation and existence of positive externalities. Social implications Stronger user involvement"," a joint innovation strategy for healthcare, academia, and industry"," and institutional reform are necessary to remove blocking mechanisms that today prevent innovation from occurring. Originality/value This study is the first to provide an analysis of the system of innovation in healthcare using a functional dynamics approach, which has evolved as a tool for public policy making. A better understanding of ISs in general, and in healthcare in particular, may provide the basis for designing and evaluating innovation policy."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1108/JHOM-04-2016-0061,*Delivery of Health Care",*Diffusion of Innovation,Health Facilities,Humans,Interviews as Topic,Organizational Case Studies,

In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the trustworthiness of published papers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers and even experienced researchers. METHODS: This proof-of-concept study used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared to existing similar articles. RESULTS: The study found that the AI language model can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in the generated article, specifically in the references. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript preparation and language editing."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/46924,Humans",*Artificial Intelligence,*Algorithms,Language,Semantics,"Data Analysis,37256685,PMC10267787",,,

Its use is limited by concerns about risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to develop a model to predict risk of CKD following lithium treatment initiation, by identifying individuals with a high-risk trajectory of kidney function. METHODS: We used United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) electronic health records (EHRs) from 2000 to 2018. CPRD Aurum for prediction model development and CPRD Gold for external validation. We used elastic net regularised regression to generate a prediction model from potential features. We performed discrimination and calibration assessments in an external validation data set. We included all patients aged = 16 with bipolar disorder prescribed lithium. To be included patients had to have = 1 year of follow-up before lithium initiation, = 3 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measures after lithium initiation (to be able to determine a trajectory) and a normal (= 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) eGFR at lithium initiation (baseline). In the Aurum development cohort, 1609 fulfilled these criteria. The Gold external validation cohort included 934 patients. We included 44 potential baseline features in the prediction model, including sociodemographic, mental and physical health and drug treatment characteristics. We compared a full model with the 3-variable 5-year kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) and a 3-variable elastic net model. We used group-based trajectory modelling to identify latent trajectory groups for eGFR. We were interested in the group with deteriorating kidney function (the high-risk group). RESULTS: The high risk of deteriorating eGFR group included 191 (11.87%) of the Aurum cohort and 137 (14.67%) of the Gold cohort. Of these, 168 (87.96%) and 117 (85.40%) respectively developed CKD 3a or more severe during follow-up. The model, developed in Aurum, had a ROC area of 0.879 (95%CI 0.853-0.904) in the Gold external validation data set. At the empirical optimal cut-point defined in the development dataset, the model had a sensitivity of 0.91 (95%CI 0.84-0.97) and a specificity of 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.82). However, a 3-variable elastic net model (including only age, sex and baseline eGFR) performed similarly well (ROC area 0.888"," 95%CI 0.864-0.912), as did the KFRE (ROC area 0.870"," 95%CI 0.841-0.898). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals at high risk of a poor eGFR trajectory can be identified before initiation of lithium treatment by a simple equation including age, sex and baseline eGFR. Risk was increased in individuals who were younger at commencement of lithium, female and had a lower baseline eGFR. We did not identify strong predicters of eGFR decline specific to lithium-treated patients. Notably, lithium duration and toxicity were not associated with high-risk trajectory."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12916-021-01964-z,""*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/epidemiology",Cohort Studies,Female,Glomerular Filtration Rate,Humans,Lithium/adverse effects,

To address this, we explored the association between components of social performance and PLEs in adolescents aged 13-18 using a novel virtual reality (VR) paradigm for real-time assessment. METHODS: Adolescents (N = 146) aged 13-18 were recruited as part of a larger cohort study conducted by the same research group (YVORI_PRO) and invited to participate via the following criteria: those reporting highly indicative positive PLEs (HIP, N = 88) and those reporting no or less indicative PLEs (no-HIP, N = 58). Self-report, behavioural and physiological components of social performance were collected using a portable VR headset and a medical wristband. Participants entered a virtual recreational area with three levels of social ambiguity and were encouraged to interact with avatars. MANOVA was performed to check for overall group differences and repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to examine the effects of group and level of ambiguity, as well as their interaction, on daily social performance. RESULTS: During virtual social interactions, adolescents with HIP reported higher levels of anxiety, fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and avoidance than the no-HIP group. No significant difference between groups was found for self-confidence. With increasing social ambiguity in VR, anxiety, FNE and avoidance increased in both groups, while self-confidence decreased. No significant group differences were found in behavioural or physiological components of social performance. Interpersonal distance and pulse rate increased significantly with increasing level of ambiguity, but pulse rate variability and skin conductance did not. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that adolescents with HIP may present specific difficulties related to social performance, which may carry additional psychosis risk. The new VR social scenario appears to be an acceptable, safe and effective tool to measure social performance in adolescents experiencing PLEs."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00127-025-02871-x,"""",40097692,",,,,,,,,

However, no ML mortality risk prediction algorithm has been prospectively validated in oncology or compared with routinely used prognostic indices. OBJECTIVE: To validate an electronic health record-embedded ML algorithm that generated real-time predictions of 180-day mortality risk in a general oncology cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study comprised a prospective cohort of patients with outpatient oncology encounters between March 1, 2019, and April 30, 2019. An ML algorithm, trained on retrospective data from a subset of practices, predicted 180-day mortality risk between 4 and 8 days before a patient's encounter. Patient encounters took place in 18 medical or gynecologic oncology practices, including 1 tertiary practice and 17 general oncology practices, within a large US academic health care system. Patients aged 18 years or older with outpatient oncology or hematology and oncology encounters were included in the analysis. Patients were excluded if their appointment was scheduled after weekly predictions were generated and if they were only evaluated in benign hematology, palliative care, or rehabilitation practices. EXPOSURES: Gradient-boosting ML binary classifier. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the patients' 180-day mortality from the index encounter. The primary performance metric was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Among 24 582 patients, 1022 (4.2%) died within 180 days of their index encounter. Their median (interquartile range) age was 64.6 (53.6-73.2) years, 15 319 (62.3%) were women, 18 015 (76.0%) were White, and 10 658 (43.4%) were seen in the tertiary practice. The AUC was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88-0.90) for the full cohort. The AUC varied across disease-specific groups within the tertiary practice (AUC ranging from 0.74 to 0.96) but was similar between the tertiary and general oncology practices. At a prespecified 40% mortality risk threshold used to differentiate high- vs low-risk patients, observed 180-day mortality was 45.2% (95% CI, 41.3%-49.1%) in the high-risk group vs 3.1% (95% CI, 2.9%-3.3%) in the low-risk group. Integrating the algorithm into the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and Elixhauser comorbidity index-based classifiers resulted in favorable reclassification (net reclassification index, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.04-0.14] and 0.23 [95% CI, 0.20-0.27], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, an ML algorithm was feasibly integrated into the electronic health record to generate real-time, accurate predictions of short-term mortality for patients with cancer and outperformed routinely used prognostic indices. This algorithm may be used to inform behavioral interventions and prompt earlier conversations about goals of care and end-of-life preferences among patients with cancer."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.4331,Aged",Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,*Life Expectancy,*Machine Learning,Middle Aged,*Neoplasms/mortality,

This paper aims to complement the discourse on digitalization in dentistry by analyzing precisely these challenges. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The study is based on an analysis of international publications and specialist writings on digitalization and its applications in the fields of dentistry and medicine, as well as on the analysis of specific contributions from the disciplines of medical ethics and medical law, and from the public media. RESULTS: The paper identifies and discusses eight core challenges: (1) big data (""""digital double"""" and falsification in dentistry), (2) the dental practitioner-patient relationship, (3) digital literacy, (4) the assumption of responsibility in complex systems, (5) accompanying changes in the dental professions, (6) cost trap and risks of overtreatment in dentistry, (7) consumption spiral and ecologic footprint, and (8) clinical evidence in dental treatments.

As AI technologies continue to evolve, there is an urgent need to establish a unified framework that guides the design, implementation, and evaluation of AI-driven interventions across individual and population health contexts. APPROACH: In response to this need, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) has initiated the development of an AI code of conduct (AICC) through its Digital Health Action Collaborative. This code of conduct is grounded in shared principles and commitments, aiming to actualize ethical and effective AI practices within the broader health and healthcare ecosystem. Given its specialized expertise and insight, the biomedical informatics (BMI) community plays a pivotal role in shaping and applying these guidelines. RECOMMENDATIONS: We, as members of the AICC Steering Committee and the NAM Digital Health Action Collaborative, urge BMI educators, researchers, and practitioners to engage actively in refining and implementing the AICC.

Therefore, this paper aims to investigate digital perceptions and competencies among medical students in pediatrics and pediatric healthcare workers in China. METHODS: A questionnaire on digital competency was designed. The formal survey was carried out from  February to May 2024 in pediatric students and pediatricians. Data were analyzed by SPSS20.0 software. RESULTS: The study included 518 valid questionnaires"," 199 medical students in pediatrics and 319 pediatric healthcare workers. In all five themes, pediatric healthcare workers and pediatric students had a mean score higher than 3.0, and the former scored higher. There was no significant difference in the digital competency in pediatricians (3.91) compared to pediatric students (3.82) (P > 0.05). Multivariable analysis revealed that gender and education level were related with digital competency, with male medical students (3.94 vs. 3.75, P = 0.021) and those with higher levels of education (3.99 vs. 3.75, P = 0.030) having better performance. In addition, medical students in pediatric surgery scored higher than those who majored in internal pediatrics (4.11 vs. 3.76, P = 0.017).

We compared physician-reported conflict-of-interest (COI) disclosures in journal articles with this database to determine any discrepancies in physician-reported disclosures. METHODS: COIs reported by authors from 2014 through 2016 were analyzed in 3 journals: Foot & Ankle International (FAI), The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery (JBJS), and The Journal of Arthroplasty (JOA). Payment information in the CMS Open Payments database was cross-referenced with each author's disclosure statement to determine if a disclosure discrepancy was present. RESULTS: We reviewed 3,465 authorship positions (1,932 unique authors) in 1,770 articles. Within this sample, 7.1% of authorships had a recorded undisclosed COI (disclosure discrepancy), and 13.2% of articles had first and/or last authors with a disclosure discrepancy. Additionally, we saw a great variation in the percentage of authorships with disclosure discrepancies among the journals (JBJS, 2.3%"," JOA, 3.6%"," and FAI, 23.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies exist between payment disclosures made by authors and those published in the CMS Open Payments database. Although the percentage of articles with these discrepancies varies widely among the journals that were analyzed in this study, no trend was found when analyzing the number of discrepancies over the 3-year period. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: COI disclosures are important for the interpretation of study results and need to be accurately reported.

METHODS: The responses of 406 caregivers of terminal cancer patients enrolled in a trial determining the efficacy of a decision aid focused on the disclosure of terminal disease status were included in this secondary analysis. The outcomes include the change scores of the Decision Conflict Scale (DCS) and depression and anxiety subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at the 1 and 3 months from baseline. The linear mixed model was employed to discover the impact of caregivers' decisional role preference on the outcomes. FINDINGS: Of the 406, 137 (33.7%) showed an active role preference and 269 (66.3%) showed a passive role preference. In the post hoc analysis of the adjusted differences of change scores between passive caregivers who received decision aid (passive-decision aid) and active caregivers with decision aid (active-decision aid), non-significant differences were observed in the DCS.

Then, as an illustration, we provide a case example of this approach using the Food, Culture, and Health Study conducted with Black Jamaican American and Somali American youth and families, who experience tridimensional acculturation due to their race and have been disproportionately impacted by the dual pandemics of COVID-19 and racism/Whiteness. We offer this article as a road map for other researchers seeking to conduct ethical digital community-based psychological research with Black immigrant youth and families and other marginalized communities.

Nursing plays an essential role in this practice as it is the key to accessing the healthcare system. It is important that this branch of nursing is developed considering all the ethical aspects of nursing care, and not just the legal concepts of the practice. However, this question has not been widely explored in the literature and it is of crucial relevance in the new concept of care. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review is to identify the ethical aspects of the development of telemedicine from a nursing practice perspective. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature based on Arksey and O'Malley's framework. The search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE and CINAHL databases, from 2012 to 2022. A total of 1322 articles were retrieved, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The research was conducted in accordance with the best scientific practices. FINDINGS: The most relevant aspects were the safety of the patient, the benefits for the user and the digital competence of the professionals. Informed consent and patient's willingness to use new technologies were relevant to the practice, as was person-centered care and how telemedicine can influence the quality of the therapeutic relationship. Another relevant issue was the concern about professional competence for optimal outcomes. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to further explore and develop the ethical aspects of the new practices, disassociating them from the legal aspects only. Professionals demand more training providing them with more competence and confidence."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1177/09697330231209291,""Humans",*Telemedicine/ethics,"Ethics, Nursing",Nurses/psychology/statistics & numerical data,"Attitude of Health Personnel"",38115684,",,,,

METHODS: A retrospective PACS search identified adults who underwent an emergency department contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT in 07/2022 (Console Cohort) and 07/2023 (Server Cohort). Coronal and sagittal multiplanar reformatted images (MPR) were created by AI software in the Server cohort. Time to completion of MPR images was compared using 2-sample t-tests for all patients in both cohorts. Two radiologists qualitatively assessed image quality and diagnostic confidence on 5-point Likert scales for 50 consecutive examinations from each cohort. Additionally, they assessed for acute abdominopelvic findings. Continuous variables and qualitative scores were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. A p < .05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: Mean[SD] time to exam completion in PACS was 8.7[11.1] minutes in the Console cohort (n = 728) and 4.6[6.6] minutes in the Server cohort (n = 892), p < .001. 50 examinations in the Console Cohort (28 women 22 men, 51[19] years) and Server cohort (27 women 23 men, 57[19] years) were included for radiologist review.

Because this relationship can influence medical research and practice, reporting disclosures are necessary to reveal any potential bias and inform consumers. The Sunshine Act was created to develop a new reporting system of these financial relationships called the Open Payments database. Currently all disclosures submitted with research to scientific meetings are at the discretion of the physician. We hypothesized that financial relationships between authors and the medical industry are underreported. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe concordance between physicians' financial disclosures listed in the abstract book from the 41st annual scientific meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons to physician payments reported to the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services Open Payments database for the same year. STUDY DESIGN: Authors and scientific committee members responsible for the content of the 41st annual scientific meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons were identified from the published abstract book"," each abstract listed disclosures for each author. Abstract disclosures were compared with the transactions recorded on the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services Open Payments database for concordance. Two authors reviewed each nondisclosed Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services listing to determine the relatedness between the company listed on the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services and abstract content. RESULTS: Abstracts and disclosures of 335 physicians meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed. A total of 209 of 335 physicians (62%) had transactions reported in the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, which totaled $1.99 million. Twenty-four of 335 physicians (7%) listed companies with their abstracts"," 5 of those 24 physicians were concordant with the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The total amount of all nondisclosed transactions was $1.3 million.

However, current approaches to governance focus on high-level principles rather than tailored recommendations for specific domains like consumer health. This gap risks unintended consequences from generic guidelines misapplied across contexts and from providing answers before agreeing on the questions. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to explore pragmatic multi-stakeholder approaches to govern consumer-facing health AI. The aims are to (1) establish an approach tailored for consumer health AI governance and (2) identify key constraints and desirable model characteristics. METHODS: This paper synthesizes insights informed by a 4-month multidisciplinary expert consensus process with nearly 200 participants. The deliberations provided guidance for the development of the proposed governance models in consumer health AI. RESULTS: (1) A Shared View of Consensus: A process for consumer health AI governance should limit the scope and incorporate multi-stakeholder perspectives centered on patient needs. Desirable model characteristics include adaptability, patient empowerment, and transparency. (2) Recommended Collaborative Process: A pathway for effective governance should begin by forming a Health AI Consumer Consortium (HAIC(2)) representing patients and aligning incentives across stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: While examples focus on the United States healthcare system, core themes around incorporating consumer voices, enabling transparency, and balancing innovation with thoughtful oversight while avoiding overambitious scope will have relevance globally. As consumer AI spreads worldwide, the multi-stakeholder alignment and patient empowerment principles proposed here may offer productive ways to ensure AI for consumers is safe, effective, equitable, and trustworthy (SEET)."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105713,Humans",*Artificial Intelligence,Consumer Health Informatics,"Stakeholder Participation,39642592,",,,,,

Caring for a family member may be a positive experience. It may, however, also be a negative experience as symptoms like disturbing behavior and delusions may be difficult to encounter. The burden of being a family caregiver has been shown to affect the caregivers' quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To explore stakeholders' perspectives on a potential mobile application through which family caregivers could be supported by healthcare professionals in caring for a person with dementia living at home. METHOD: Eight individual interviews with family caregivers and a focus group with eight healthcare professionals specialized in dementia care were analyzed using content analysis method. RESULTS: The findings suggest that a mobile application can support family caregivers to meet their own needs in terms of finding structure in everyday life, how to get information and support in their own pace, and how to care for themselves. The findings also suggest the necessity of accessing relevant contact networks to be supported in the ability to care for a family member with dementia. CONCLUSION: Healthcare and social services mediated support provided through user-friendly mobile application has the potential to support family caregivers both in taking care of a person with dementia and caring for themselves. Moreover, it is important that the information provided to family caregivers is personalized according to the needs of the family caregivers as the family member's dementia advances."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1177/14713012211065313,Caregivers",*Dementia/therapy,Health Personnel,Humans,*Mobile Applications,"Quality of Life,35300535,",,,"Young Adult"",32252755,PMC7137226"

To optimize the adoption of eCME and develop efficient and cost-effective eCME programs, factors explaining GPs' intention to use eCME must first be elucidated. METHODS: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, we developed a questionnaire and administered it to GPs in seven CME seminars in Isfahan, Iran, in 2014. Three domains of GPs' intention to use eCME were measured: attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms. We used linear and logistic regression to identify the main predictors of intention and behavior. RESULTS: GPs who had high score in perceived behavioral control and a more positive attitude toward e-learning had a higher intention to adopt it for CME. In contrast, subjective norms (eg, social pressures to use eCME) were not a predictor. Attitude toward usefulness of eCME was the main predictor of being an actual eCME user. DISCUSSION: Perceived behavioral control and attitude constitute the main predictors of the intention to use eCME. Establishing discussions forums and strengthening organizational support for eCME through an increased awareness among clinical superiors and CME managers would be expected to increase GPs' intention to use eCME."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: antes de 2016"",10.1097/CEH.0000000000000123,""Adult",Aged,*Attitude of Health Personnel,Chi-Square Distribution,"Computers, Handheld/statistics & numerical data","*Education, Medical, Continuing",Female,General Practitioners/*psychology,

Technology has entered the clinical space and raises new ethical dilemmas for mental health clinicians. After an update on this shifting landscape, including a brief review of important literature since 2014, this article will demonstrate how core ethical principles may be applied to clinical situations with patients, using vignettes for illustration. RECENT FINDINGS: The vast majority of adolescents (95%) across all demographic groups can access smartphones (Anderson et al. 2018?). Technology use in mental health is also expanding, including a proliferation of """"apps."""" While qualitative data from technology experts reports overall positive effects of technology (Anderson and Rainie 2018), concern about its potential negative impact on youth mental health remains high, and an association between technology use and depression is strong. Internet addiction, online sexual exploitation, and accessing illicit substances through the """"dark net"""" pose additional clinical and legal concerns. In this context, clinicians have an ethical responsibility to engage in education and advocacy, to explore technology use with teen patients and to be sensitive to ethical issues that may arise clinically, including confidentiality, autonomy, beneficence/nonmaleficence, and legal considerations such as mandated reporting. New media and digital technologies pose unique ethical challenges to mental health clinicians working with adolescents. Clinicians need to stay abreast of current trends and controversies about technology and their potential impact on youth and engage in advocacy and psychoeducation appropriately. With individual patients, clinicians should watch for potential ethical dilemmas stemming from technology use and think them through, with consultation as needed, by applying longstanding core ethical principles."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11920-018-0974-z,Adolescent",Adolescent Behavior/*psychology,Confidentiality/ethics,Equipment and Supplies Utilization/*statistics & numerical data,Humans,Mental Health/*ethics,Mobile Applications/statistics & numerical data,Screen Time,

RESULTS: Time from first application to receipt of data was more than two years for most state data-sets. Several challenges were unique to linkages involving identifiable data from a non-government clinical registry. Concerns about consent, the re-identification of data, duality of data custodian roles and data ownership were raised. Requirements involved the development of data flow methods, separating roles and multiple governance and ethics approvals. Approval to link death data presented the fewest barriers.

This data challenge has attracted engineers to create software that aims to improve cancer diagnosis or treatment. However, the move to use computers in the oncology clinic for diagnosis or treatment has led to instances of premature or inappropriate use of computational predictive systems. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate best practices for developing and assessing the clinical utility of predictive computational methods in oncology. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The National Cancer Policy Forum and the Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a workshop to examine the use of multidimensional data derived from patients with cancer and the computational methods used to analyze these data. The workshop convened diverse stakeholders and experts, including computer scientists, oncology clinicians, statisticians, patient advocates, industry leaders, ethicists, leaders of health systems (academic and community based), private and public health insurance carriers, federal agencies, and regulatory authorities. Key characteristics for successful computational oncology were considered in 3 thematic areas: (1) data quality, completeness, sharing, and privacy"," (2) computational methods for analysis, interpretation, and use of oncology data"," and (3) clinical infrastructure and expertise for best use of computational precision oncology. FINDINGS: Quality control was found to be essential across all stages, from data collection to data processing, management, and use. Collecting a standardized parsimonious data set at every cancer diagnosis and restaging could enhance reliability and completeness of clinical data for precision oncology. Data completeness refers to key data elements such as information about cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, while data quality depends on whether appropriate variables have been measured in valid and reliable ways. Collecting data from diverse populations can reduce the risk of creating invalid and biased algorithms. Computational systems that aid clinicians should be classified as software as a medical device and thus regulated according to the potential risk posed. To facilitate appropriate use of computational methods that interpret high-dimensional data in oncology, treating physicians need access to multidisciplinary teams with broad expertise and deep training among a subset of clinical oncology fellows in clinical informatics.

There are increasing expectations for radiology practices to deliver a dedicated emergency radiology service providing 24/7/365 on-site attending radiologist coverage. Emergency radiologists (ERs) are pressed to meet the demand of increased imaging volume, provide accurate reports, maintain a lower proportion of discrepancy rate, and with a rapid report turnaround time of finalized reports. Thus, rendering the radiologists overburdened. The demand for an increased efficiency in providing quality care to acute patients has led to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field. AI can be used to assist emergency and trauma radiologists deal with the ever-increasing imaging volume and workload, as AI methods have typically demonstrated a variety of applications in medical image analysis and interpretation, albeit most programs are in a training or validation phase.

The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences VIII suggests considering adjustments such as stratification when they can enhance the sensitivity and/or specificity of statistical analysis. However, several database-specific and statistical caveats have been identified when adjusting for covariates derived from the SRS. Disproportionality analysis may be affected not only by reporting bias at the time of enrollment but also by sparse-data bias due to variations in the number of enrollment reports. Statistical evidence is needed to determine in which cases and to what extent sensitivity and/or specificity are affected.

Dementia management should involve preventative methods, including during the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Lay-caregivers are found to have poorer health in all three domains of the biopsychosocial model, as a result of the burden of care. New assistive technologies (ATs) have been designed to help care for PwD. ATs aim to be more affordable and widely available than human workers, achieving greater health equity and quality of life for all. METHODS: To identify relevant articles, a literature search using PubMed was undertaken by one independent reviewer: S.L.C. The keywords of """"dementia"""", """"technology"""", and """"management"""" were used, with no date of publication limitations, which revealed 571 results. RESULTS: 44 articles were included in this review. Articles regarding new technologies to diagnose dementia or MCI were not included. ATs aim to help facilitate aging-in-place, reduce medical costs, and rates of caregiver burnout, by helping maintain patient functioning. DISCUSSION: Legal issues in the form of workplace safety laws, data privacy laws and regulations, and health care ethics are major barriers to implementation that need to be resolved. The hope is that artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be able to advance what they are able to perceive and help uncover new knowledge and management options for dementia and MCI."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103135,Activities of Daily Living",Artificial Intelligence,*Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis,*Dementia/diagnosis,Humans,PubMed,Quality of Life/psychology,"*Self-Help Devices,35569363,",

It is the authors' goal to identify evidence-based recommendations within the literature to help guide the process of designing a new registry with optimal efficiency, workability and data use. The objective of this study is to examine the primary literature for evidence-based recommendations on how to design and establish a cancer registry, with a focus on literature which analyses the performance and usefulness of already established registries or guidelines. METHODS: An electronic search was completed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMCARE, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Recommendations were extracted from the identified articles and collated as themes. RESULTS: Nine articles of varying quality were included in the review. Recommendations obtained from the literature included broad themes of the importance of clinician involvement, establishment of clear data definitions, number of variables used, inbuilt strategies to improve quality and completeness of data, considerations of costs, an 'opt-out' strategy for ethics and privacy and flexibility of the system. CONCLUSION: This review concluded that there is a large gap in the primary literature for evidence-based recommendations on the design and establishment of cancer registries.

METHODS: Data were collected cross-sectionally. A social constructivist paradigm was adopted, and one-on-one videoconference-based, semi-structured interviews were conducted with SPIN-CHAT Trial participants and research team members. A hybrid inductive-deductive approach and reflexive thematic analysis were used. RESULTS: Of the 40 SPIN-CHAT Trial participants and 28 research team members approached, 30 trial participants (Mean age = 54.9"," SD = 13.0 years) and 22 research team members agreed to participate. Those who took part in interviews had similar characteristics to those who declined. Five themes were identified: (1) The SPIN-CHAT Program conferred a range of positive psychological health outcomes, (2) People who don't have SSc don't get it: The importance of SSc-specific programming, (3) The group-based format of the SPIN-CHAT Program created a safe space to connect and meet similar others, (4) The structure and schedule of the SPIN-CHAT Program reduced feelings of boredom and contributed to enhanced psychological health, (5) The necessity of knowledge, skills, and tools to self-manage SSc and navigate COVID-19.

The Tisdale risk score calculator uses clinical variables to predict which hospitalized patients are at the highest risk for QTc prolongation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of overridden QTc drug-drug interaction (DDI)-related clinical decision support (CDS) alerts per patient admission and the prevalence by Tisdale risk score category of these overridden alerts. Secondary outcome was to determine the rate of drug-induced QTc prolongation (diQTP) associated with overrides. METHODS: Our organization's enterprise data warehouse was used to retrospectively access QTc DDI alerts presented for patients aged = 18 years who were admitted to Brigham and Women's Hospital during 2022. The QTc DDI CDS alerts were included if shown to a physician, fellow, resident, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner when entering the order in inpatient areas for patients with a length of stay of at least 2 days. Variables collected for the Tisdale calculator included age, sex, whether patient was on a loop diuretic, potassium level, admission QTc value, admitting diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, or heart failure, and number of QTc-prolonging drugs given to the patient. RESULTS: A total of 2649 patients with 3033 patient admissions had 18,432 QTc DDI alerts presented that were overridden. An average of 3 unique QTc DDI alerts were presented per patient admission and the alerts were overridden an average of 6 times per patient admission. Overall, 6% of patient admissions were low risk (score = 6), 64% moderate risk (score 7-10), and 30% high risk (score = 11) of QTc prolongation. The most common QTc DDI alerts overridden resulting in an diQTP were quetiapine and propofol (11%) and amiodarone and haloperidol (7%). The diQTP occurred in 883 of patient admissions (29%) and was more frequent in those with higher risk score, with 46% of patient admissions with diQTP in high risk, 23% in moderate risk, and 8% in low risk.

We sought to determine whether general surgery residency faculty could detect AI versus human-written responses to a text prompt"," hypothesizing that faculty would not be able to reliably differentiate AI versus human-written responses. METHODS: Ten essays were generated using a text prompt, """"Tell us in 1-2 paragraphs why you are considering the University of Rochester for General Surgery residency"""" (Current trainees: n = 5, ChatGPT: n = 5). Ten blinded faculty reviewers rated essays (ten-point Likert scale) on the following criteria: desire to interview, relevance to the general surgery residency, overall impression, and AI- or human-generated"," with scores and identification error rates compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups for %total points (ChatGPT 66.0 ± 13.5%, human 70.0 ± 23.0%, P = 0.508) or identification error rates (ChatGPT 40.0 ± 35.0%, human 20.0 ± 30.0%, P = 0.175).

CONCLUSIONS: Whether use of AI tools for academic purposes should constitute academic dishonesty is controversial. We demonstrate that human and AI-generated essays are similar in quality, but there is bias against presumed AI-generated essays.

OBJECTIVE: To determine genetic researchers' interest in doing research with diverse ancestral populations, which database stewards offer adequate samples, and additional facilitators for use of diverse ancestral data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study was conducted from June to December 2022 and was part of an exploratory sequential mixed-methods project in which previous qualitative results informed survey design. Eligible participants included genetic researchers who held US academic affiliations and conducted research using human genetic databases. EXPOSURE: Internet-administered survey to genetic research professionals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The survey assessed respondents' experience and interest in research with diverse ancestral data, perceptions of adequacy of diverse data across database stewards (ie, private, government, or consortia), and identified facilitators for encouraging use of diverse ancestral data. Descriptive statistics, ?2 tests, and z tests were used to describe respondents' perspectives and experiences. RESULTS: A total of 294 researchers (171 men [58.5%]"," 121 women [41.2%]) were included in the study, resulting in a response rate of 20.4%. Across seniority level, 109 respondents (37.1%) were senior researchers, 85 (28.9%) were mid-level researchers, 71 (24.1%) were junior researchers, and 27 (9.2%) were trainees. Significantly more respondents worked with data from European ancestral populations (261 respondents [88.8%]) compared with any other ancestral population. Respondents who had not done research with Indigenous ancestral groups (210 respondents [71.4%]) were significantly more likely to report interest in doing so than not (121 respondents [41.2%] vs 89 respondents [30.3%]"," P < .001). Respondents reported discrepancies in the adequacy of ancestral populations with significantly more reporting European samples as adequate across consortium (203 respondents [90.6%]), government (200 respondents [89.7%]), and private (42 respondents [80.8%]) databases, compared with any other ancestral population. There were no significant differences in reported adequacy of ancestral populations across database stewards. A majority of respondents without access to adequate diverse samples reported that increasing the ancestral diversity of existing databases (201 respondents [68.4%]) and increasing access to databases that are already diverse (166 respondents [56.5%]) would increase the likelihood of them using a more diverse sample. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US genetic researchers, respondents reported existing databases only provide adequate ancestral samples for European populations, despite their interest in other ancestral populations. These findings suggest there are specific gaps in access to and composition of genetic databases, highlighting the urgent need to boost diversity in research samples to improve inclusivity in genetic research practices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.6805,""Male",Humans,Female,"Databases, Factual",*Government,*Indigenous Peoples,

Many trials fail to meet recruitment targets resulting in underpowered studies which waste resources and the time of those who participated. While there is evidence that many people are willing to take part in research, particularly if it involves a condition from which they suffer, researchers are unable to easily contact such people often relying on busy clinicians to identify them. Many clinicians perceive themselves as too busy to take part in research activities. The Scottish Health Research Register SHARE adopts an approach which asks the public to consent to their data held in National Health Service databases to be used to determine their suitability for research projects. Additionally, participants can consent for spare blood, left after routine venepuncture to be automatically identified in the laboratory and stored for future research studies. PARTICIPANTS: Anyone over the age of 16 years in Scotland can participate. Participants are approached through a range of methods including directly at outpatient clinics and general practitioners practices, leaflets with hospital letters and personal email from employers. FINDINGS TO DATE: SHARE has recruited around 130 000 people. SHARE has demonstrated that it can quickly and efficiently recruit to studies, over 20 until now. In addition, it can be used to administer questionnaire studies by email and recruit to patient and public involvement groups. FUTURE PLANS: SHARE continues to steadily recruit with the ambition of eventually achieving 1 000 000 people in Scotland.

However, ethical questions arise regarding whether database users have a reasonable expectation that their DNA information will be searched by law enforcement in this way, and so, in turn, questions about consent and privacy have emerged. While initial surveys suggest generally positive support for using genetic genealogy methods, less work has explored the underlying reasons behind this support.

As policymakers demonstrate interest in regulating IGG, it is important to understand public perspectives on IGG to determine whether proposed policies are aligned with public attitudes. METHODS: We conducted eight focus groups with members of the public (N = 72), sampled from four geographically diverse US regions, to explore general attitudes and perspectives regarding aspects of IGG practices, applications, and policies. Five major topics were explored in each focus group: when IGG should be used", who should perform IGG, how to approach consent for genetic database users, what systems of oversight should govern IGG practitioners," and whether to notify database users if their data are involved in law enforcement (LE) matching. RESULTS: Participants were supportive of IGG in most scenarios, especially for cold and violent cases. The favorable attitudes toward IGG were, however, tempered by distrust of law enforcement among some participants. All participants agreed that databases must inform users if IGG is allowed, but they did not agree on how individual database users should be allowed to opt out or whether to notify them if their data are involved in specific investigations. All participants agreed that IGG should be subject to some prescriptive guidelines, regulations, or accountability mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest broad public support for IGG, and interest in developing systems of accountability for its practice.

This client is able to browse, select, compose parameters, invoke, and monitor the execution of Web Services stored in catalogues or central repositories. The client is also able to deal with huge amounts of data between external storage mounts. In addition, we also present a validation use case, which illustrates the usage of the application while executing, monitoring, and exploring the results of a registered workflow. The software its available in the Apple Store and Android Market and the source code is publicly available in Github. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile devices are becoming increasingly important in the scientific world due to their strong potential impact on scientific applications. Bioinformatics should not fall behind this trend. We present an original software client that deals with the intrinsic limitations of such devices and propose different guidelines to provide location-independent access to computational resources in bioinformatics and biomedicine. Its modular design makes it easily expandable with the inclusion of new repositories, tools, types of visualization, etc."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-018-4439-x,""*Computational Biology","*Computers, Handheld",Internet,*Software,User-Computer Interface,"Workflow"",29338691,PMC5771032",,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Keypoint annotations were carried out in 595 digital bitewing radiographic images using a Computer Vision Annotation Tool. The dataset was splitted: 416 of these images were trained using the You Only Look Once version 8 architecture with pose estimation (YOLO-v8-pose), 119 images were destined for the validation set, and 60 images were used for the test set, resulting in a model capable of detecting keypoints related to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and alveolar bone crest (ABC). In order to evaluate the performance of the obtained model, the following metrics were analyzed: F1-Score, precision, sensitivity and mean average precision (mAP). Then, an algorithm was implemented to measure the RBL by calculating the Euclidean distance between CEJ and ABC. RESULTS: The model achieved an F1-Score of 66,89%, precision of 61,1%, a sensitivity of 73,9% and an mAP of 73.8%.

Research shows challenges in learning and applying ethics. Ethical Coffee Room is an electronic platform, where the students, nurses and teachers discuss anonymously ethical issues during students' clinical practice. ECR offers 1 credit (27 working hours) for the students. This work included reading theoretical material, contributions for discussion of ethical dilemmas and reflection of one's own learning. Every user - student, nurse supervisor or teacher - could choose her or his own pseudonym. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe how nursing students experience learning ethics with digital learning activity during clinical practice, how usable the Ethical Coffee Room platform is and how this learning activity should be developed further. RESEARCH DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND CONTEXT: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design and was an EU project between Finland, Sweden and Latvia. In total, 34 second-year nursing students participated in the study. The data collection methods were semi-structured interviews and written comments in the discussion forum Ethical Coffee Room. The data were analysed using content analysis. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical approval and research permission were obtained from each partner organization, according to their national standards. FINDINGS: The results are presented under three themes: positive learning experiences of Ethical Coffee Room, challenges in learning during Ethical Coffee Room and practical suggestions for future development of Ethical Coffee Room. The results showed that the Ethical Coffee Room was experienced as a novel type of learning activity and an interesting way to learn ethics. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Ethical Coffee Room seems to be a promising learning activity enhancing students' ethical competence in clinical practice. However, active participation of the mentor nurses and teachers is essential. Therefore, mentor nurses and teachers need in-depth knowledge of ethical theories and concepts and how to apply them in clinical context."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1177/0969733020934145,"""",32666868,",,,,,,,,

This charge is rapidly evolving due to forces such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data (opportunistic imaging, imaging prognostication), and advanced diagnostic technologies. A new modernistic paradigm is emerging whereby radiologists, in conjunction with computer algorithms, will be tasked with extracting as much information from imaging data as possible, often without a specific clinical question being posed and independent of any stated clinical need. In addition, AI algorithms are increasingly able to predict long-term outcomes using data from seemingly normal examinations, enabling AI-assisted prognostication. As these algorithms become a standard component of radiology practice, the sheer amount of information they demand will increase the need for streamlined workflows, communication, and data management techniques. In addition, the provision of such information raises reimbursement, liability, and access issues.

Until now, this technology has not been routinely used in connection with an emergency call in which location data play a decisive role This study evaluated a new software automatically providing emergency medical service (EMS) dispatchers with a caller's geolocation. We hypothesized that this technology will provide higher accuracy, faster dispatching of EMS and a faster beginning of thoracic compressions in a cardiac arrest scenario. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Approval from the local Ethics Committee was obtained. 108 simulated emergency calls reporting a patient in cardiac arrest were conducted at 54 metropolitan locations, which were chosen according to a realistic pattern. At each location, a conventional emergency call, with an oral description of the location, was given first"," subsequently, another call using an app with automatic geolocation was placed. Accuracy of localization, time to location, time to EMS dispatch and time to first thoracic compression were compared between both groups. RESULTS: The conventional emergency call was always successful (n = 54). Emergency call via app worked successfully in n = 46 cases (85.2%). Automatic geolocation was provided to EMS in all these n = 46 cases (100%). Deviation from estimated position to actual position was 1173.5 ± 4343.1 m for conventional and 65.6 ± 320.5 m for automatic geolocalization (p < 0.001). In addition, time to localization was significantly shorter using automatic geolocalization (34.7 vs. 71.7 s, p < 0.001). Time to first thoracic compression was significantly faster in the geolocalization group (83.0 vs. 122.6 s"," p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that automatic geolocalization leads to a significantly shorter duration of the emergency call, significantly shorter times until the beginning of thoracic compressions, and a higher precision in determining the location of an emergency."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.10.030,""*Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/methods/standards",Emergency Medical Dispatch/methods,Emergency Medical Service Communication Systems/trends,Geographic Information Systems/*instrumentation,Humans,Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/*therapy,

This study aimed to construct and validate a comprehensive dual-energy computed tomography-based radiomics model for differentiating patients with and without gout flares. METHODS: The analysis included 200 patients, of whom 150 were confirmed to have experienced at least one flare in the past 12 months"," the remaining 50 patients did not experience flares. The radiomic features of the tophi at the bilateral first metatarsophalangeal joints were extracted and analyzed. Optimal radiomic features were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method, and logistic regression analysis was used to screen clinical characteristics and establish a clinical model. The optimal radiomic features were then combined with the identified independent clinical variables to develop a comprehensive model. The performances of the radiomic, clinical, and comprehensive models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Four radiomic features distinguished patients with at least one flare from those without flares and were used to establish the radiomic model. Disease duration and hypertension were independent factors that differentiated flare occurrences. The radiomic, clinical, and comprehensive models showed favorable discrimination, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69-0.83), 0.72(95% CI, 0.63-0.80), and 0.79(95% CI, 0.73-0.86), respectively. The calibration curves (P > 0.05) showed that the differentiated values of the comprehensive model agreed well with the actual values. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the comprehensive model achieved higher net clinical benefits than the use of either the radiomic or clinical model alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the national research ethics committee, and written patient consent was obtained. Thirty patients with asthma underwent breath-hold CT at total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. (3)He and (1)H MR images were acquired during the same breath hold at a lung volume of functional residual capacity plus 1 L. Lobar segmentations delineated by major fissures on both CT scans were used to calculate the percentage of ventilation per lobe from the change in inspiratory and expiratory lobar volumes. CT-based ventilation was compared with (3)He MR imaging ventilation by using diffeomorphic image registration of (1)H MR imaging to CT, which enabled indirect registration of (3)He MR imaging to CT. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The mean ± standard deviation absolute difference between the CT and (3)He MR imaging percentage of ventilation volume in all lobes was 4.0% (right upper and right middle lobes, 5.4% ± 3.3"," right lower lobe, 3.7% ± 3.9"," left upper lobe, 2.8% ± 2.7"," left lower lobe, 3.9% ± 2.6"," Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < .05).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving 66 children who underwent chest CT, with 33 having non-thymomatous OMG and 33 healthy children without any abnormality. We recorded CT features of the thymus in each child, including the mean CT attenuation value, thymus area, area ratio, anteroposterior (AP) length, width (W), thickness (T), and transverse diameter (TD). These characteristics were analyzed to distinguish OMG from healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to clarify the best assessment, and the optimal cut-off values were determined. RESULTS: The mean CT attenuation value, the thymus area, area ratio, and TD were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two groups. The mean CT attenuation value was the most significant characteristic in differentiating OMG and healthy controls (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.70). Using 50.41 as the cut-off value for mean CT attenuation, a specificity of 0.70 and sensitivity of 0.82 was observed for distinguishing the two groups (P = 0.003).

RESULTS: We used a linear mixed model framework to assess the correlation of DNA methylation at ~ 400 k CpGs with gene expression changes at ~ 13 k transcripts in two independent datasets from human blood cells. Among CpGs at which methylation significantly associates with transcription (eCpGs), > 50% are distal (> 50 kb) or trans (different chromosome) to the correlated gene. Many eCpG-transcript pairs are consistent between studies and ~ 90% of neighboring eCpGs associate with the same gene, within studies. We find that enhancers (P < 5e-18) and microRNA genes (P = 9e-3) are overrepresented among trans eCpGs, and insulators and long intergenic non-coding RNAs are enriched among cis and distal eCpGs. Intragenic-eCpG-transcript correlations are negative in 60-70% of occurrences and are enriched for annotated gene promoters and enhancers (P < 0.002), highlighting the importance of intragenic regulation. Gene Ontology analysis indicates that trans eCpGs are enriched for transcription factor genes and chromatin modifiers, suggesting that some trans eCpGs represent the influence of gene networks and higher-order transcriptional control. CONCLUSIONS: This work sheds new light on the interplay between epigenetic changes and gene expression, and provides useful data for mining biologically-relevant results from epigenome-wide association studies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-018-4842-3,""Adolescent",Adult,Aged,Blood Cells/*metabolism,Cohort Studies,CpG Islands,*DNA Methylation,"*Epigenesis, Genetic",

To address this limitation, a clinical decision support system (CDSS) was developed for the diagnosis and quantification of the severity of lumbosacral radiculopathy based on intramuscular electromyography (iEMG) signals. The CDSS uses the EMG interference pattern method (QEMG IP) to directly extract features from the iEMG signal and provide a quantitative expression of injury severity for each muscle and overall radiculopathy severity. From 126 time and frequency domain features, a set of five features, including the crest factor, mean absolute value, peak frequency, zero crossing count, and intensity, were selected. These features were derived from raw iEMG signals, empirical mode decomposition, and discrete wavelet transform, and the wrapper method was utilized to determine the most significant features. The CDSS was trained and tested on a dataset of 75 patients, achieving an accuracy of 93.3%, sensitivity of 93.3%, and specificity of 96.6%. The system shows promise in assisting physicians in diagnosing lumbosacral radiculopathy with high accuracy and consistency using iEMG data. The CDSS's objective and standardized diagnostic process, along with its potential to reduce the time and effort required by physicians to interpret EMG signals, makes it a potentially valuable tool for clinicians in the diagnosis and management of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Future work should focus on validating the system's performance in diverse clinical settings and patient populations."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11517-024-03196-8,""Humans",*Electromyography/methods,*Radiculopathy/diagnosis/physiopathology,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",Male,Female,Adult,Middle Aged,

In times of digitalization, teleconsultation for medical images and cases plays an increasing role in neurosurgical services. However, no standards and demands have been established for its execution in the subfield of neurosurgery, so far. Therefore, as a first step, we performed a survey about the current state of teleconsultation in neurosurgery in Germany. METHODS:  A standardized questionnaire consisting of 20 items was used to investigate the frequency of use and the operating conditions of teleconsultation in the field of neurosurgery. The survey was performed during the annual national German Society of Neurosurgery conference in 2017. Participation in the written survey was on voluntary and anonymous basis. RESULTS:  In total, 296 individuals took part in the survey (140 specialists in neurosurgery, 77 residents). Among them, 71% were male and 121 worked at a university medical center. In total, 87.5% of all participants indicated that teleconsultation was used in their institutions (n = 113 in university medical centers and n = 76 in hospitals), and a vast majority stated to have had personal experience with it (88.6% of specialists, 85.5% of residents). The most frequent initial request for a consultation was done by phone call (80.3%). Images or data were then primarily transmitted via an electronic system (77.3%), followed by transmissions via CD or by post. The reply to a consultation was also mainly done by phone call (91.3%), followed by fax, or by e-mail. No standard protocol was followed by 78.6% of the respondents, and they stated not to know about the statutory and legal rules. However, it was stated that the protection of patient data was not endangered by using teleconsultation. The usefulness of teleconsultation and its future relevance were rated highly by the participants. The risk of misinterpretation of image data, especially without having direct access to other patient data, seemed to be a critical and unequivocal challenge. CONCLUSION:  The results of the survey demonstrate that teleconsultation for medical images and cases is a frequently used and well-accepted tool in neurosurgical health care. However, a standardized neurosurgical procedure is still lacking and the statutory rules for this field of digital medicine are generally not known in our community. Potential misinterpretation and resulting misjudgment seem to be realistic drawbacks. Thus, we see a necessity for elaboration of guidelines for teleconsultation in neurosurgery on national and European basis."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1055/s-0040-1710505,Adult",Aged,Female,Germany,Humans,Internship and Residency,Male,Middle Aged,

METHODS: Bioinformatic analysis was performed using data in the Oncomine database, Kaplan- Meier Plotter online software, MethHC database, catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC), cbioportal database and String database. Then, we verified the association between RECQL5 expression and GC prognosis by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The independent prognostic factors were determined by Cox multivariate analysis. RESULTS: It was found that both the mRNA and protein expression levels of RECQL5 were downregulated in GC samples (P < .05). Low RECQL5 expression indicated a poor prognosis in GC patients and is the independent prognostic factors for GC. No correlation between RECQL5 mRNA and DNA methylation was found using the MethHC database. The analysis of the COSMIC database showed a high proportion of missense mutation in GC. The functional enrichment analysis predicted that RECQL5 plays a role in DNA repair and cellular responses to DNA damage stimulus. RECQL5 might be enriched in homologous recombination pathways and Fanconi anemia pathway. Bioinformatics analysis identified 5 genes, namely POLR2D, POLR2G, DXO, KIN, and EIF2D, that were significantly correlated with RECQL5.

Given that the archival specimens were likely obtained prior to the era of informed consent, this raises questions about their appropriate and ethical use. Because some institutions in the United States retain archival collections of embryonic and fetal specimens that were once used as educational tools, their existence and utility require frequent reexamination against contemporary ethical frameworks to guide appropriate use or utilization.

Semi-automated threshold-based methods (SAT) have been proposed for CMR post-processing as alternatives to fully manual standard tracing. We investigated the impact of SAT on RV analysis using different thresholds in rTOF patients. METHODS: RV volumes and mass were estimated using SAT and standard fully manual tracing methods in rTOF patients. Two threshold levels were set for SAT, i.e., default 50 (SAT-50) and 30 (SAT-30). RV stroke volumes (SV) were compared to main pulmonary artery forward flow (MPA-FF). Post-processing time, intra- and interobserver variabilities were compared across methods. RESULTS: Sixty-two CMRs of rTOF patients were analyzed. Compared to the standard fully manual tracing, no significant differences in RV mass, volumes and ejection fraction were observed using SAT-30, whereas SAT-50 significantly underestimated RV end-diastolic-volume index (EDVi) by 10.4% (mean difference of - 11.8 ± 6.2 ml/m(2), p 0.03) and overestimated RV mass index by 21.8% (mean difference of 14.2 ± 11.9 g/m(2), p 0.002). Compared to MPA-FF, RVSV by standard fully manual method and SAT-30 showed minor biases, respectively, 0.03 ml/m(2) and 0.7 ml/m(2), while SAT-50 underestimated RVSV by 6.86 ml/m(2) (p < 0.001). In six patients, the degree of RV EDVi underestimation by SAT-50 determined a change of category from dilated to non-dilated RV.

To compare the 90-day postoperative adverse events following laminectomy in patients with and without achondroplasia. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the 2010-2020 PearlDiver Mariner 91 administrative database was used to identify patients who underwent thoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbar laminectomy. Patients with achondroplasia were matched 1:4 to patients without achondroplasia based on age, sex, insurance, and ECI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed and compared 90-day adverse events. Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values were reported with significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A multivariate analysis revealed that when laminectomy was performed, patients with achondroplasia were 2.82 times more likely to have 90-day AE compared to those without achondroplasia (p < 0.001). When comparing individual subtypes of adverse events, patients with achondroplasia were found to have significantly greater odds of a transfusion (OR 6.40, p < 0.001), UTI (OR 3.79, p < 0.001), disruption of wound (OR 3.71, p < 0.001), and hematoma (OR 2.94, p = 0.032). Pneumonia, cardiac arrest, AKI, other perioperative events, durotomy, and VTE were not significantly different between the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: This study uses one of the largest cohorts to compare patients with and without achondroplasia undergoing laminectomy.

Patients were classified into mild to moderate and severe depression groups according to the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores. VMHC differences between these subgroups and their associations with HAMD scores were further examined. The results revealed significant reductions in VMHC within the fusiform gyrus for patients with mild to moderate depression compared to HCs, alongside more extensive reductions across the insula, postcentral gyrus, and angular gyrus in severe depression. Notably, increased VMHC in the middle cingulate cortex was identified in severe MDD patients relative to those with mild to moderate depression, with this increase showed a significant positive correlation with the HAMD scores. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that VMHC values in these regions effectively differentiate patients from HCs and across varying severities of MDD.

However, sustained use of one-on-one peer support requires a good match between patient and peer mentor. Using an artificial intelligence (AI) matching algorithm has the potential to improve peer matching by achieving complex, preference-based matching. Therefore, using stakeholder co-design, this study identified patient preferences for peer matching criteria and other features of OpalBuddy, a digital peer support service to be developed within the Opal patient portal. METHODS: Patients using the Opal app were recruited, and semi-structured individual interviews were carried out with eight available women cancer patients. Qualitative data analysis followed an iterative and collaborative thematic analysis approach, using computer-assisted software (NVivo). RESULTS: Three themes, with supporting sub-themes, that describe patient preferences for matching with an ideal peer mentor were identified: Theme 1. An ideal mentor can provide support at multiple levels, with sub-themes describing the levels: (A) Sharing illness experiences, (B) Practical information support, (C) Emotional support, (D) Social management coaching. Theme 2. The ideal mentor has similar lived experience, with sub-themes describing the type of lived experience: (A) Similar clinical situation, (B) Similar socio-demographics, (C) Interpersonal affinity. Theme 3. The ideal peer mentor will be supported in their role, with sub-themes describing support options: (A) Formal or informal training, (B) General guidance, (C) Supportive supervision. Finally, based on different support needs (practical vs emotional), it was found that patients had varying, even opposing, expectations from a mentor's interpersonal communication style (solution focused vs good listener). CONCLUSION: Patient preferences for an ideal peer mentor were identified through semi-structured interviews with a sample of eight women with a diverse set of cancers.

Recent molecular biology advances have illuminated ALL's complex molecular pathways, notably the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling system and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This work aimed to unravel the molecular complexities of the link between Hh signaling and ALL by concentrating on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their interactions with significant Hh pathway genes. METHODS: To analyze differentially expressed lncRNAs and genes in ALL, microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was reanalyzed using a systems biology approach. Hh signaling pathway-related genes were identified and their relationship with differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs) was analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis. A regulatory network was built by identifying miRNAs that target Hh signaling pathway-related mRNAs. RESULTS: 193 DEGs and 226 DElncRNAs were found between ALL and normal bone marrow samples. Notably, DEGs associated with the Hh signaling pathway were correlated to 26 DElncRNAs. Later studies showed interesting links between DElncRNAs and biological processes and pathways, including drug resistance, immune system control, and carcinogenic characteristics. DEGs associated with the Hh signaling pathway have miRNAs in common with miRNAs already known to be involved in ALL, including miR-155-5p, and miR-211, highlighting the complexity of the regulatory landscape in this disease. CONCLUSION: The complex connections between Hh signaling, lncRNAs, and miRNAs in ALL have been unveiled in this study, indicating that DElncRNAs linked to Hh signaling pathway genes could potentially serve as therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers for ALL."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00277-024-05763-3,""Humans",*Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/metabolism,*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism,*Signal Transduction/genetics,*Computational Biology,"*RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics","Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic",MicroRNAs/genetics,

METHODS: This descriptive study recruited 278 women in the postpartum period. Data were collected from the Digital Motherhood Survey. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analysis were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 28.9 ± 5.14 years"," 50.4% had a high school education or less, and 49.6% had a university education or higher.

Traditional continuity, based on a one-to-one doctor-patient relationship, has declined in recent years. Contemporary general practice is organisationally and technically complex, with multiple staff roles and technologies supporting patient access (e.g. electronic and telephone triage) and clinical encounters (e.g. telephone, video and electronic consultations). Re-evaluation of continuity's relational, organisational, socio-technical and professional characteristics is therefore timely. We developed theory in parallel with collecting and analysing data from case studies of 11 UK general practices followed from 2021 to 2023 as they introduced (or chose not to introduce) remote and digital services. We used strategic, immersive ethnography, interviews, and material analysis of technologies (e.g. digital walk-throughs). Continuity was almost universally valued but differently defined across practices. It was invariably situated and effortful, influenced by the locality, organisation, technical infrastructure, wider system and the values and ways of working of participating actors, and often requiring articulation and 'tinkering' by staff. Remote and digital modalities provided opportunities for extending continuity across time and space and for achieving-to a greater or lesser extent-continuity of digital records and shared understandings of a patient and illness episode across the clinical team. Delivering continuity for the most vulnerable patients was sometimes labour-intensive and required one-off adaptations. Building on earlier work by Haggerty et al. we propose a novel ontology of four analytically distinct but empirically overlapping kinds of continuity-of the therapeutic relationship (based on psychodynamic and narrative paradigms), of the illness episode (biomedical-interpretive paradigm), of distributed work (sociotechnical paradigm), and of the practice's commitment to a community (political economy and ethics of care paradigm). This ontology allowed us to theorise and critique successes (continuity achieved) and failures (breaches of continuity and fragmentation of care) in our dataset."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116112,""Humans",*Physician-Patient Relations,*General Practice,"Anthropology, Cultural",Referral and Consultation,"Technology"",37535988,",,,

Despite IT advances, the methods for involving patients and citizens in biomedical research remain static, paper-based and organized around national boundaries and anachronistic legal frameworks. The purpose of this paper is to study the current practices for obtaining consent for biobanking and the legal requirements for reusing the available biomaterial and data in EU and finally to present a novel tool to this direction enabling the secondary use of data and biomaterial. METHOD: We review existing European legislation for secondary use of patient's biomaterial and data for research, identify types and scopes of consent, formal requirements for consent, and consider their implications for implementing electronic consent tools. To this direction, we proceed further to develop a modular tool, named Donor's Support Tool (DST), designed to connect researchers with participants, and to promote engagement, informed participation and individual decision making. RESULTS: To identify the advantages of our solution we compare our tool with six other relevant approaches. The results show that our tool scores higher than the other tools in functionality, security and intelligence whereas it is the only one free and open-source.

The indication under review is the detection, using artificial intelligence (AI) software, of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (i.e., ischemic stroke) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (i.e., hemorrhagic stroke) for people of any age with a suspected acute stroke. WHAT IS RAPIDAI? RapidAI is an AI-enabled software platform that facilitates the viewing, processing, and analysis of CT imaging to aid clinicians in assessing patients, including those with suspected stroke. It builds on the original RAPID software, initially developed to automate and expedite the postprocessing of CT perfusion imaging. Currently, the platform also incorporates modules that perform AI-driven detection of LVO and ICH, which were the functionalities evaluated in this review. RapidAI is intended to complement, rather than replace, clinician interpretation of CT imaging and is to be used as a supportive tool rather than a standalone diagnostic intervention. HOW DID CANADA?S DRUG AGENCY EVALUATE THIS TECHNOLOGY? To examine the value of implementing RapidAI for detecting LVO and ICH, Canada?s Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) conducted an evidence review on RapidAI that identified, synthesized, and critically appraised literature evaluating RapidAI?s effectiveness, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. CDA-AMC highlighted and reflected on the ethical and equity implications of using RapidAI for stroke detection, engaged a patient contributor, sought feedback from knowledge users, and consulted an expert panel. While RapidAI has numerous features and functionalities, what is relevant for this report are the modules that perform AI-driven detection of LVO and ICH to inform stroke diagnosis. No additional features or functionalities, such as the postprocessing of CT perfusion imaging, were assessed. WHAT ELSE DID CDA-AMC DO? CDA-AMC applied Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC), a checklist currently used in the UK, to the health care context in Canada to determine whether we have equivalent or similar measures, strategies, and policies to implement digital health technologies safely. CDA-AMC also conducted a literature review to identify implementation guidance specific to AI-enabled medical device use and relevant to Canada to supplement DTAC. For this work, CDA-AMC integrated ethics and equity considerations, leveraged patient engagement activities conducted in the concurrent RapidAI review, sought feedback from knowledge users, and consulted an expert panel. WHAT IS THE HEALTH TECHNOLOGY EXPERT REVIEW PANEL RECOMMENDATION FOR RAPIDAI? In locations where RapidAI has already been implemented for use in detecting suspected LVO and ICH, the Health Technology Expert Review Panel (HTERP) recommends RapidAI is used only as indicated, alongside clinician interpretation of CT imaging, to reduce the risk of incorrect results"," and the generation of evidence to evaluate its value in health care systems, including its use in less-resourced centres with limited access to stroke care specialists. In locations considering the implementation of RapidAI for use in detecting suspected LVO and ICH, given the uncertainty and gaps in the evidence regarding clinical, economic, and equity value of RapidAI, HTERP cannot provide recommendations for or against its implementation."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",,"""",39869727,",,,,,,,

We used individual participant data meta-analysis to compare prevalence based on standard Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - depression subscale (HADS-D) cutoffs of =8 and =11 versus Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) major depression and determined if an alternative HADS-D cutoff could more accurately estimate prevalence. METHODS: We searched Medline, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations via Ovid, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (inception-July 11, 2016) for studies comparing HADS-D scores to SCID major depression status. Pooled prevalence and pooled differences in prevalence for HADS-D cutoffs versus SCID major depression were estimated. RESULTS: 6005 participants (689 SCID major depression cases) from 41 primary studies were included. Pooled prevalence was 24.5% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 20.5%, 29.0%) for HADS-D =8, 10.7% (95% CI: 8.3%, 13.8%) for HADS-D =11, and 11.6% (95% CI: 9.2%, 14.6%) for SCID major depression. HADS-D =11 was closest to SCID major depression prevalence, but the 95% prediction interval for the difference that could be expected for HADS-D =11 versus SCID in a new study was -21.1% to 19.5%. CONCLUSIONS: HADS-D =8 substantially overestimates depression prevalence. Of all possible cutoff thresholds, HADS-D =11 was closest to the SCID, but there was substantial heterogeneity in the difference between HADS-D =11 and SCID-based estimates.

A cross-sectional study over 14 weeks was performed electronically with support from the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) and a national trainee-led recruitment team. Ethics approval was obtained at the lead centre. A total of 132 participants joined the study (70% consultants, 25% specialty registrars, and 5% other), approximating a 29% response rate from consultant/registrar BAOMS members throughout mainland UK. Eighty-eight per cent used CAD-CAM design, with highly variable funding/access, design/manufacturing workflows (in-house/outsourced). Eighty-eight per cent were involved with trauma, 61% with orthognathic, and 52% with oncology-reconstruction surgery. Favourite applications for printed titanium were orbital floor repair (89%) and free-flap jaw reconstruction (87%). Most participants also cited maxillary/zygomatic osteotomies and cranioplasty (range 61%-73%). Although a popular application (78%), the evidence base in temporomandibular joint surgery is limited. Those performing orthognathic surgery perceived more indications than those who did not (p=0.013). Key barriers included cost, turnaround time and logistics, and the need to be trained in traditional techniques. Printed titanium was useful for both common and niche procedures, but was specifically limited in emergency trauma. Most surgeons had experience in CAD-CAM surgery but technical understanding appeared unclear. Limiting factors included variable funding and production pathways, perceived costs, and logistics, but in-house design can minimise them. In part II, we quantify perceived benefits and limitations and whether surgeons' understanding and knowledge are sufficient to rationalise them."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.087,""Computer-Aided Design",Cross-Sectional Studies,*Dental Implants,Humans,"Printing, Three-Dimensional",*Plastic Surgery Procedures,"*Surgery, Computer-Assisted",Titanium,

METHODS: We conducted three co-design workshops at an Australian quaternary cancer centre. Participants were patients who had received/were receiving ICI or their caregivers, managing clinicians, administration staff, and electronic medical record (EMR) analysts. Workshop 1 identified preferences for an ideal ePRO system, informing the development of a prototype and generic workflow. Workshop 2 sought feedback on the prototype and workflow.

METHODS: Two digital surveys were formulated, one covering clinical and scientific parameters and one exploring ethical and regulatory issues around informed consent. RESULTS: Data were analysed for 20 common responses, from 7 European countries. Tissue was the main sample type biobanked with 63 % also banking blood. Documentation of clinical data, treatment regimens and classification systems varied. Eighty percent collected pathological information.

There appeared to be no systematic decision-making process in deciding whether to adopt artificial intelligence. In its absence, a number of contextual factors influenced procurement decisions. ? Incorporating artificial intelligence-based technology into existing models of social care provision requires alterations to existing funding models and care pathways, as well as workforce training. ? Technology-enabled care solutions require robust digital infrastructure, which is lacking for many of those who draw on care and support. ? Short-term service pressures and a sense of crisis management are not conducive to the culture that is needed to reap the potential longer-term benefits of artificial intelligence. LIMITATIONS: Significant recruitment challenges (especially regarding people who draw on care and carers) were faced, particularly in relation to pressures from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a number of common implementation challenges, and adds insight around the specific decision-making processes for a technology that has been implemented in social care. We have also identified issues related to managing and analysing data, and introducing a technology focused on prevention into an environment which is focused on dealing with crises. This has helped to fill gaps in the literature and share practical lessons with commissioners, social care providers, technology providers and policy-makers. FUTURE WORK: We have highlighted the implications of our findings for future practice and shared these with case study sites. We have also developed a toolkit for others implementing new technology into adult social care based on our findings (https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/college-social-sciences/social-policy/brace/ai-and-social-care-booklet-final-digital-accessible.pdf). As our findings mirror the previous literature on common implementation challenges and a tendency of some technology to 'over-promise and under-deliver', more work is needed to embed findings in policy and practice.

Previous methods tackling label variability focus on 2D segmentation and single modalities, but reliable 3D multi-modal approaches are necessary for clinical applications such as in oncology. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating reliable and unbiased labels with minimal radiologist input for supervised 3D segmentation, reducing radiologists' efforts and variability in manual labeling. Our framework generates AI-assisted labels through a two-step process involving 3D multi-modal unsupervised segmentation based on feature clustering and semi-supervised refinement. These labels are then compared against traditional expert-generated labels in a downstream task consisting of 3D multi-modal bone tumor segmentation. Two 3D-Unet models are trained, one with manually created expert labels and the other with AI-assisted labels. Following this, a blind evaluation is performed on the segmentations of these two models to assess the reliability of training labels. The framework effectively generated accurate segmentation labels with minimal expert input, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The model trained with AI-assisted labels outperformed the baseline model in 61.67% of blind evaluations, indicating the enhancement of segmentation quality and demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted labeling to reduce radiologists' workload and improve label reliability for 3D multi-modal bone tumor segmentation.

Many companies remain wary about such sharing because of unaddressed concerns about ethics, data security, logistics, and public relations. Without guidance on these issues, few companies are willing to take on the potential work and risks involved in noncommercial data sharing, and the scientific and societal potential of their data goes unrealized. In this paper, we describe the 18-month long pilot of a data-sharing program led by Crisis Text Line (CTL), a not-for-profit technology company that provides a free 24/7 text line for people in crisis. The primary goal of the data-sharing pilot was to design, develop, and implement a rigorous framework of principles and protocols for the safe and ethical sharing of user data. CTL used a stakeholder-based policy process to develop a feasible and ethical data-sharing program. The process comprised forming a data ethics committee", identifying policy challenges and solutions, announcing the program and generating interest," and revising the policy and launching the program. Once the pilot was complete, CTL examined how well the program ran and compared it with other potential program models before putting in place the program that was most suitable for its organizational needs. By drawing on CTL's experiences, we have created a 3-step set of guidelines for other organizations that wish to develop their own data-sharing program with academic researchers. The guidelines explain how to (1) determine the value and suitability of the data and organization for creating a data-sharing program", (2) decide on an appropriate data sharing and collaboration model," and (3) develop protocols and technical solutions for safe and ethical data sharing and the best organizational structure for implementing the program. An internal evaluation determined that the pilot satisfied CTL's goals of sharing scientific data and protecting client confidentiality. The policy development process also yielded key principles and protocols regarding the ethical challenges involved in data sharing that can be applied by other organizations. Finally, CTL's internal review of the pilot program developed a number of alternative models for sharing data that will suit a range of organizations with different priorities and capabilities. In implementing and studying this pilot program, CTL aimed both to optimize its own future data-sharing programs and to inform similar decisions made by others. Open data programs are both important and feasible to establish. With careful planning and appropriate resources, data sharing between big data companies and academic researchers can advance their shared mission to benefit society and improve lives."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/11507,Computer Security/*standards",Crisis Intervention/*methods,Data Collection/*standards,

Theoretical and conceptual research in AI ethics needs to be complemented with empirical research to understand the values and judgments of members of the public, who will be the ultimate recipients of AI-enabled services. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Australian Values and Attitudes on AI (AVA-AI) study was to assess and compare Australians' general and particular judgments regarding the use of AI, compare Australians' judgments regarding different health care and social service applications of AI, and determine the attributes of health care and social service AI systems that Australians consider most important. METHODS: We conducted a survey of the Australian population using an innovative sampling and weighting methodology involving 2 sample components: one from an omnibus survey using a sample selected using scientific probability sampling methods and one from a nonprobability-sampled web-based panel. The web-based panel sample was calibrated to the omnibus survey sample using behavioral, lifestyle, and sociodemographic variables. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: We included weighted responses from 1950 Australians in the web-based panel along with a further 2498 responses from the omnibus survey for a subset of questions. Both weighted samples were sociodemographically well spread. An estimated 60% of Australians support the development of AI in general but, in specific health care scenarios, this diminishes to between 27% and 43% and, for social service scenarios, between 31% and 39%. Although all ethical and social dimensions of AI presented were rated as important, accuracy was consistently the most important and reducing costs the least important. Speed was also consistently lower in importance. In total, 4 in 5 Australians valued continued human contact and discretion in service provision more than any speed, accuracy, or convenience that AI systems might provide. CONCLUSIONS: The ethical and social dimensions of AI systems matter to Australians. Most think AI systems should augment rather than replace humans in the provision of both health care and social services. Although expressing broad support for AI, people made finely tuned judgments about the acceptability of particular AI applications with different potential benefits and downsides. Further qualitative research is needed to understand the reasons underpinning these judgments. The participation of ethicists, social scientists, and the public can help guide AI development and implementation, particularly in sensitive and value-laden domains such as health care and social services."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/37611,*Artificial Intelligence",Attitude,Australia,*Delivery of Health Care,Humans,"Social Work,35994331,PMC9446139",,,

However, the involvement of the target patient group is necessary to develop digital devices that are closely aligned to the needs of this particular patient group. OBJECTIVE: Participatory design approaches, such as cocreation, may be a solution for achieving usability and user acceptance. However, there are currently no set methods for implementing cocreative development processes incorporating patients. This study addresses the following research questions: what are the tasks and challenges associated with the involvement of patient groups? What lessons can be learned regarding the adequate involvement of patients with long COVID? METHODS: First, a literature review based on a 3-stage snowball process was conducted to identify the tasks and challenges emerging in the context of the cocreation of digital assistive devices and services with patient groups. Second, a qualitative analysis was conducted in an attempt to extract relevant findings and criteria from the identified studies. Third, using the method of theory adaptation, this paper presents recommendations for the further development of the existing concepts of cocreation in relation to patients with long COVID. RESULTS: The challenges of an active involvement of patients in cocreative development in health care include hierarchical barriers and differences in the levels of specific knowledge between professionals and patients. In the case of long COVID, patients themselves are still inexperienced in dealing with their symptoms and are hardly organized into established groups. This amplifies general hurdles and leads to questions of group identity, power structure, and knowledge creation, which are not sufficiently addressed by the current methods of cocreation.

We aimed to explore Australians' experiences with these types of tests, especially online DNA tests, and their views regarding whom they would seek support from around understanding test results. The study used a mixed methods approach, employing an exploratory quantitative online survey and follow-up qualitative semi-structured interviews. Between May 2016 and May 2017, 2841 Australians responded to the survey. Interviews were conducted with 63 purposively sampled respondents, including 45 who had a genetic test and 18 who had not. Of 571 respondents who had any type of genetic test, 322 had a personal genomic test using criteria defined by the researchers. Testing for ancestry/genealogy was the most common, reported by 267 participants, reflecting the increased advertising of these tests in Australia. Some respondents described downloading their raw data for further interpretation through third party websites for genealogical as well as health related information. Carrier testing, testing for serious and preventable conditions and nutrition and/or wellness were the most common health related tests reported by respondents. Participants generally preferred to seek support from general practitioners (GPs), medical specialists with relevant expertise and independent genetics specialists, although another important preference for non-health information was online forums and networks. There was less preference for seeking support from employees associated with the testing companies. Generally, of those who had a health related PGT, the most common actions were seeking medical advice or doing nothing with the information, while more of those who had a personal genomic test for nutrition and/or wellness sought advice from complementary/alternative health practitioners (eg naturopaths) and integrative GPs, and 60% reported they had changed their diet. As awareness of personal genomic testing increases, publicly funded clinical genetics services may be less inclined to discuss results from personal genomic testing. Genetic counsellors could play an important role in providing this support, both pre-test and post-test, through opportunities for private practice but independent from testing companies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.ejmg.2018.11.002,""Adolescent",Adult,Aged,Australia,Direct-To-Consumer Screening and Testing/*psychology/statistics & numerical data,Facilities and Services Utilization,Female,Genetic Testing/methods/*statistics & numerical data,

One particular example of such a tool is ChatGPT which is the first and world's most popular multipurpose generative AI tool. This study aims to put forward a policy-making framework of generative artificial intelligence based on the risk, reward, and resilience framework. A systematic search was conducted, by using carefully chosen keywords, excluding non-English content, conference articles, book chapters, and editorials. Published research were filtered based on their relevance to ChatGPT ethics, yielding a total of 41 articles. Key elements surrounding ChatGPT concerns and motivations were systematically deduced and classified under the risk, reward, and resilience categories to serve as ingredients for the proposed decision-making framework. The decision-making process and rules were developed as a primer to help policymakers navigate decision-making conundrums. Then, the framework was practically tailored towards some of the concerns surrounding ChatGPT in the context of higher education. In the case of the interconnection between risk and reward, the findings show that providing students with access to ChatGPT presents an opportunity for increased efficiency in tasks such as text summarization and workload reduction. However, this exposes them to risks such as plagiarism and cheating. Similarly, pursuing certain opportunities such as accessing vast amounts of information, can lead to rewards, but it also introduces risks like misinformation and copyright issues. Likewise, focusing on specific capabilities of ChatGPT, such as developing tools to detect plagiarism and misinformation, may enhance resilience in some areas (e.g., academic integrity). However, it may also create vulnerabilities in other domains, such as the digital divide, educational equity, and job losses. Furthermore, the finding indicates second-order effects of legislation regarding ChatGPT which have implications both positively and negatively. One potential effect is a decrease in rewards due to the limitations imposed by the legislation, which may hinder individuals from fully capitalizing on the opportunities provided by ChatGPT. Hence, the risk, reward, and resilience framework provides a comprehensive and flexible decision-making model that allows policymakers and in this use case, higher education institutions to navigate the complexities and trade-offs associated with ChatGPT, which have theoretical and practical implications for the future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7717/peerj-cs.1845,"""",38440047,PMC10911759",,,,,,,,

However, for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), priority is based on binary tumor criteria to expedite transplant for patients with 'acceptable' post-transplant outcomes. Newer risk scores developed to overcome limitations of these binary criteria are insufficient to be used for waitlist priority as they focus solely on HCC-related pre-transplant variables. We sought to develop a risk score to predict post-transplant survival for patients using HCC- and non-HCC-related variables. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using national registry data on adult deceased-donor liver transplant (DDLT) recipients with HCC from 2/27/02-12/31/18. We fit Cox regression models focused on 5- and 10-year survival to estimate beta coefficients for a risk score using manual variable selection. We then calculated absolute predicted survival time and compared it to available risk scores. RESULTS: Among 6,502 adult DDLT recipients with HCC, 11 variables were selected in the final model. The AUCs at 5- and 10-years were: 0.62, 95% CI 0.57-0.67 and 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.72, which was not statistically significantly different to the Metroticket and HALT-HCC scores. The LiTES-HCC score was able to discriminate patients based on post-transplant survival among those meeting Milan and UCSF criteria. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a risk score to predict post-transplant survival for patients with HCC. By including HCC- and non-HCC-related variables (e.g., age, chronic kidney disease), this score could allow transplant professionals to prioritize patients with HCC in terms of predicted survival. In the future, this score could be integrated into survival benefit-based models to lead to meaningful improvements in life-years at the population level. LAY SUMMARY: We created a risk score to predict how long patients with liver cancer will live if they get a liver transplant. In the future, this could be used to decide which waitlisted patients should get the next transplant."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.jhep.2020.12.021,""Aged","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*surgery",Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Liver Neoplasms/*surgery,Liver Transplantation/*mortality,Male,

While equivalence with a PHQ-9 cutoff of = 10 was not established, we found the sensitivity of the PHQ-Dep-4 to be non-inferior to that of the PHQ-9, and the specificity of the PHQ-Dep-4 to be marginally smaller than the PHQ-9."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.ymeth.2021.11.005,""*Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis",Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Patient Health Questionnaire,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,"*Tool Use Behavior"",34780986,PMC11719774",,

Little is known about the sustainability of interventions to address this problem. OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term impact on acute care nurses of a 6-session experiential educational program called the Mindful Ethical Practice and Resilience Academy (MEPRA). METHODS: MEPRA includes facilitated discussion, role play, guided mindfulness and reflective practices, case studies, and high-fidelity simulation training to improve nurses' skills in mindfulness, resilience, and competence in confronting ethical challenges. A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted on the impact of the MEPRA curriculum at 2 hospitals in a large academic medical system. The study involved surveys of 245 nurses at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 3 and 6 months after the intervention. RESULTS: The results of the intervention were generally sustained for months afterward. The most robust improvements were in ethical confidence, moral competence, resilience, work engagement, mindfulness, emotional exhaustion, depression, and anger. Some outcomes were not improved immediately after the intervention but were significantly improved at 3 months, including anxiety and empathy. Depersonalization and turnover intentions were initially reduced, but these improvements were not sustained at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Many MEPRA results were sustained at 3 and 6 months after conclusion of the initial foundational program. Some outcomes such as depersonalization and turnover intentions may benefit from boosters of the intervention or efforts to supplement the training by making organizational changes to the work environment."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.4037/ajcc2023236,""Humans",*Mindfulness/methods,Prospective Studies,Longitudinal Studies,"*Burnout, Professional/prevention & control/psychology",Empathy,"Surveys and Questionnaires"",37121900,",,

With the wide use of EHRs, the enlargement of the care team perimeter, the need for data sharing for care continuity, the reuse of data for the sake of research, and the implementation of AI-powered decision support tools, new ethics requirements are necessary to address issues such as threats on privacy, confidentiality breaches, poor security practices, lack of patient information, tension on data sharing and reuse policies, need for more transparency on apps effectiveness, biased algorithms with discriminatory outcomes, guarantee on trustworthy AI, concerns on the re-identification of de-identified data. CONCLUSIONS: Despite privacy rules rooted in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the USA and even more restrictive new regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation published in May 2018, some people do not believe their data will be kept confidential and may not share sensitive information with a provider, which may also induce unethical situations.

This is badly needed, largely desirable and uncontroversial. However, historically, medical and healthcare practices and their informatics processes assume that individual clinical encounters between practitioners and patients are the indispensable foundation of clinical practice. This assumption has been dramatically challenged by expansion of digital technologies, their interconnectable mobility, virtuality, surveillance informatics, and the vastness of data repositories for individuals and populations that enable and support them. This article is a brief historical commentary emphasizing critical ethical issues about decisions in clinical interactions or encounters raised in the early days of the field. These questions, raised eloquently by François Grémy in 1985, have become urgently relevant to the equity/fairness, inclusivity and unbiasedness desired of today's pervasive digital health systems. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this article is to highlight how the personal freedoms of choice, values, and responsibilities arising in relationships between physicians and healthcare practitioners and their patients in the clinical encounter can be distorted by digital health technologies which focus more on efficiency, productivity, and scalability of healthcare processes. Understanding the promise and limitations of early and current decision-support systems and the analytics of community or population data can help place into historical context the often exaggerated claims made today about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning """"solving"""" clinical problems with algorithms and data, downplaying the role of the clinical judgments and responsibilities inherent in personal clinical encounters. METHODS: A review of selected early articles in medical informatics is related to current literature on the ethical issues and technological inadequacies involved in the design and implementation of clinical systems for decision-making. Early insights and cautions about the development of decision support technologies raised questions about the ethical responsibilities in clinical encounters where freedom of personal choice can be so easily limited through the constraints from information processing and reliance on prior expertise frequently driven more by administrative rather than clinical objectives. These anticipated many of the deeper ethical problems that have arisen since then in clinical informatics. CONCLUSIONS: Early papers on ethics in clinical decision-making provide prescient commentary on the dangers of not taking into account the complexities of individual human decision making in clinical encounters. These include the excessive reliance on data and experts, and oversimplified models of human reasoning, all of which persist and have become amplified today as urgent questions about how inclusivity, equity, and bias are handled in practical systems where ethical responsibilities of individuals patients and practitioners intertwine with those of groups within professional or other communities, and are central to how clinical encounters evolve in our digital health future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included"""", """"Monique""""=>""""Included"""", """"Janaina""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1055/s-0042-1742491,Humans",*Goals,Artificial Intelligence,*Medical Informatics,"Delivery of Health Care,35654428,PMC9719784",,,,"Educational Status,37884626,PMC10840852"

This process requires, amongst other things, the harmonization of these datasets, which is a prerequisite to improve their quality, re-usability and interoperability. However, there is a wide range of factors that either hinder or favor the harmonized collection, sharing and linkage of health data. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify barriers and facilitators to health data harmonization-including data sharing and linkage-by a comparative analysis of studies from Denmark and Switzerland. METHODS: Publications from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and CINAHL involving cross-institutional or cross-border collection, sharing or linkage of health data from Denmark or Switzerland were searched to identify the reported barriers and facilitators to data harmonization. RESULTS: Of the 345 projects included, 240 were single-country and 105 were multinational studies. Regarding national projects, a Swiss study reported on average more barriers and facilitators than a Danish study. Barriers and facilitators of a technical nature were most frequently reported. CONCLUSION: This systematic review gathered evidence from Denmark and Switzerland on barriers and facilitators concerning data harmonization, sharing and linkage. Barriers and facilitators were strictly interrelated with the national context where projects were carried out. Structural changes, such as legislation implemented at the national level, were mirrored in the projects. This underlines the impact of national strategies in the field of health data. Our findings also suggest that more openness and clarity in the reporting of both barriers and facilitators to data harmonization constitute a key element to promote the successful management of new projects using health data and the implementation of proper policies in this field. Our study findings are thus meaningful beyond these two countries."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included"""", """"Monique""""=>""""Included"""", """"Janaina""""=>""""Included""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design"",10.1371/journal.pone.0226015,Attitude of Health Personnel",*Communication Barriers,*Data Collection/methods/standards,Denmark/epidemiology,Electronic Health Records/organization & administration/standards,*Health Information Management/methods/organization &           administration/standards/statisti...,Humans,*Information Dissemination/methods,

Governments and research funders world-wide are recognizing this potential and making major investments in data-intensive initiatives. However, there are challenges to overcome so that safe, socially-acceptable data sharing can be achieved. This paper outlines the field of population data science, the International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN), and their roles in advancing data-intensive research. We provide an overview of core concepts and major challenges for data-intensive research, with a particular focus on ethical, legal, and societal implications (ELSI). Using international case studies, we show how challenges can be addressed and lessons learned in advancing the safe, socially-acceptable use of population data for public benefit. Based on the case studies, we discuss the common ELSI principles in operation, we illustrate examples of a data scrutiny panel and a consumer panel, and we propose a set of ELSI-based recommendations to inform new and developing data-intensive initiatives.We conclude that although there are many ELSI issues to be overcome, there has never been a better time or more potential to leverage the benefits of population data for public benefit. A variety of initiatives, with different operating models, have pioneered the way in addressing many challenges.

Implanted technologies can malfunction (eg, runaway pacemakers, hacked insulin pumps), and consumer technologies can be exploited to impose adverse health effects (eg, technology-facilitated abuse, hacks on epilepsy websites inducing seizures). Through a series of clinical simulation events, our study aimed to (1) evaluate the ability of physicians to respond to biotechnological syndromes, (2) explore gaps in training impeding effective patient care in digital cases, and (3) identify clinical cases due to digital technology arising in the population. METHODS: This was a multisite clinical simulation study. Between Jan 1 and July 1, 2023, four half-day clinical simulation events focused on digital pathologies were delivered across three NHS sites in London and the East Midlands. Participants (n=14) ranged in seniority from clinical medical students through to hospital consultants. Ethics approval was attained from University College London. Participant performance was scored by one researcher, using mark schemes built from the Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) format of UK Medical Schools. Qualitative and quantitative feedback was collected from participants following each of the four scenarios. Participants were asked to identify clinical challenges present in each simulation, discuss cases within their own practice, and evaluate the usefulness of the educational material. FINDINGS: Participants reported a wide range of examples within their own practice (eg, insulin pumps malfunctioning due to Apple watches, cardiac arrests due to faults in ventilators). Participants described barriers to treatment in simulations, including low diagnostic suspicion of technological failures, little education on biotechnological mechanisms, a lack of available expertise, and uncertainty regarding effective therapeutics. In the subjective feedback, participants reported the lowest levels of confidence when managing cases relating to software issues in medical devices, both in terms of confidence in their own ability to deliver care (mean scores: 3·6/10 junior staff, 5·8/10 senior staff) and in their teams (3·8/10 juniors, 6·8/10 seniors). INTERPRETATION: In our digital society, clinical cases related to technology are likely to increase in the population. At present, a lack of clinical awareness, education, training material, and appropriate guidelines are some of the barriers that health-care professionals face when treating these patients.

In this article, we reflect on our own research experience with digital mental health intervention design and evaluation to identify 8 of the most critical challenges that we or others have faced, and that have ethical or legal consequences. These include: (1) harm caused by online recruitment work", (2) monitoring of intervention safety, (3) exclusion of specific demographic or clinical groups, (4) inadequate robustness of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness findings, (5) adequately conceptualizing and supporting engagement and adherence, (6) structural barriers to implementation, (7) data protection and intellectual property," and (8) regulatory ambiguity relating to digital mental health interventions that are medical devices. As we describe these challenges, we have highlighted serious consequences that can or have occurred, such as substantial delays to studies if regulations around Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) are not fully understood, or if regulations change substantially during the study lifecycle. Collectively, the challenges we have identified highlight a substantial body of required knowledge and expertise, either within the team or through access to external experts. Ensuring access to knowledge requires careful planning and adequate financial resources (for example, paying public contributors to engage in debate on critical ethical issues or paying for legal opinions on regulatory issues). Access to such resources can be planned for on a per-study basis and enabled through funding proposals. However, organizations regularly engaged in the development and evaluation of digital mental health interventions should consider creating or supporting structures such as advisory groups that can retain necessary competencies, such as in medical device regulation."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included"""", """"Janaina""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/58939,Humans",

The discussion is organised around domains of use based on the actors who use the technologies, and those on whom they are used. These actors go beyond mental health service users and practitioners/service providers, and include health and social system or resource managers, data management services, private companies that collect personal data (such as major technology corporations and data brokers), and multiple government agencies and private sector actors across diverse fields of criminal justice, education, and so on.

Currently, digital security breaches are becoming more common. Healthcare data breaches have compromised over 50 million medical records per year. In Ethiopia, health digitization has grown gradually. However, there is a limitation of study in digital health security. Studying digital health data security helps individuals protect digital data as a baseline and contributes to developing a digital health security policy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the practice of healthcare professionals in digital health data security among specialized teaching referral hospitals in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study design supplemented by a qualitative purposive sampling method was used to measure the digital data security practices of health professionals. The sample size was determined via single population proportion formula. A simple random sampling technique was used for the study participants. Then, self-administered questionnaires were administered. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify associated factors using STATA software. For the qualitative study, key informant interviews were used and analyzed using thematic analysis approach via open-code software. RESULTS: Out of the 423 health professionals, 95.0% were involved in the survey. The finding indicates digital health data security practice of health professionals working at specialized teaching hospitals were 45.0%, CI: (40, 50). Health professionals 41-45-year age group (AOR = 0.107), master's degree (AOR = 2.45), postmaster's degree (AOR = 3.87), time to visit the internet for more than two hours (AOR = 2.46), basic computer training (AOR = 2.77), training in digital data security (AOR = 2.14), and knowledge (AOR = 1.76) were associated with the practice of digital health data security. For the qualitative study, three teams were prepared. The findings indicate digital health data security can be improved through training, advanced knowledge and working with digital security. CONCLUSION: The practice of digital health data security in specialized teaching hospitals in the Amhara region was inadequate. Therefore, it can be improved through enhancing education status, increasing the time needed to visit the internet, providing computer training, and updating health professionals' knowledge toward digital health data security."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included"""", """"Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-025-02902-2,Humans",Ethiopia,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Computer Security/standards,Adult,Male,Female,Health Personnel,

This will change the interaction between health care professionals and their clients, with unknown consequences. The aim of this study was to explore ethical considerations and potential consequences of using ML based decision support tools (DSTs) in the context of occupational health. Methods We conducted an ethical deliberation. This was supported by a narrative literature review of publications about ML and DSTs in occupational health and by an assessment of the potential impact of ML-DSTs according to frameworks from medical ethics and philosophy of technology. We introduce a hypothetical clinical scenario from a workers' health assessment to reflect on biomedical ethical principles: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Results Respect for autonomy is affected by uncertainty about what future consequences the worker is consenting to as a result of the fluctuating nature of ML-DSTs and validity evidence used to inform the worker. A beneficent advisory process is influenced because the three elements of evidence based practice are affected through use of a ML-DST. The principle of non-maleficence is challenged by the balance between group-level benefits and individual harm, the vulnerability of the worker in the occupational context, and the possibility of function creep. Justice might be empowered when the ML-DST is valid, but profiling and discrimination are potential risks. Conclusions Implications of ethical considerations have been described for the socially responsible design of ML-DSTs.

HICs would have broad knowledge of various kinds of health data and data quality evaluation techniques, as well as analytic skills in statistics and data interpretation. Trained also in interpersonal communication, health management, insurance systems, and medico-legal aspects of data privacy, HICs would know enough about clinical medicine to advise on the relevance of any kind of data for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Some studies even indicate that ML_CDSS may surpass physicians' competencies regarding specific isolated tasks. From an ethical perspective, however, the usage of ML_CDSS in medical practice touches on a range of fundamental normative issues. This article aims to add to the ethical discussion by using professionalisation theory as an analytical lens for investigating how medical action at the micro level and the physician-patient relationship might be affected by the employment of ML_CDSS. MAIN TEXT: Professionalisation theory, as a distinct sociological framework, provides an elaborated account of what constitutes client-related professional action, such as medical action, at its core and why it is more than pure expertise-based action. Professionalisation theory is introduced by presenting five general structural features of professionalised medical practice: (i) the patient has a concern", (ii) the physician deals with the patient's concern, (iii) s/he gives assistance without patronising, (iv) s/he regards the patient in a holistic manner without building up a private relationship," and (v) s/he applies her/his general expertise to the particularities of the individual case. Each of these five key aspects are then analysed regarding the usage of ML_CDSS, thereby integrating the perspectives of professionalisation theory and medical ethics. CONCLUSIONS: Using ML_CDSS in medical practice requires the physician to pay special attention to those facts of the individual case that cannot be comprehensively considered by ML_CDSS, for example, the patient's personality, life situation or cultural background. Moreover, the more routinized the use of ML_CDSS becomes in clinical practice, the more that physicians need to focus on the patient's concern and strengthen patient autonomy, for instance, by adequately integrating digital decision support in shared decision-making."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12910-021-00679-3,""*Decision Support Systems, Clinical","Ethics, Medical",Female,Humans,

While they offer guidance to aid developers and purchasers of such systems, they offer little specific guidance for the clinical users who will be required to use them in patient care.This paper argues that clinical, professional and reputational safety will be risked if this deficit of professional guidance for clinical users of AI-CDDSs is not redressed. We argue it is not enough to develop training for clinical users without first establishing professional guidance regarding the rights and expectations of clinical users.We conclude with a call to action for clinical regulators: to unite to draft guidance for users of AI-CDDS that helps manage clinical, professional and reputational risks.

Although eHealth could be of more value to health systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where resources are limited, identification of a competent workforce which can develop and maintain eHealth systems is a key barrier to adoption. Very little is known about the actual or optimal states of the eHealth workforce needs of LMICs. The objective of this study was to develop a framework to characterize and assess the eHealth workforce of hospitals in LMICs. METHODS: To characterize and assess the sufficiency of the workforce, we designed this study in twofold. First, we developed a general framework to categorize the eHealth workforce at any LMIC setting. Second, we combined qualitative data, using semi-structured interviews and the Workload Indicator of Staffing Needs (WISN) to assess the sufficiency of the eHealth workforce in selected hospitals in a LMIC setting like Ghana. RESULTS: We surveyed 76 (60%) of the eHealth staff from three hospitals in Ghana-La General Hospital, University of Ghana Hospital, and Greater Accra Regional Hospital. We identified two main eHealth cadres, technical support/information technology (IT) and health information management (HIM). While the HIM cadre presented diversity in expertise, the IT group was dominated by training in Science (42%) and Engineering (55%), and the majority (87%) had at least a bachelor's degree. Health information clerk (32%), health information officer (25%), help desk specialist (20%), and network administrator (11%) were the most dominant roles. Based on the WISN assessment, the eHealth workforce at all the surveyed sites was insufficient. La General and University of Ghana were operating at 10% of required IT staff capacity, while Ridge was short by 42%. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a framework to characterize and assess the eHealth workforce in LMICs. Applying it to a case study in Ghana has given us a better understanding of potential eHealth staffing needs in LMICs, while providing the quantitative basis for building the requisite human capital to drive eHealth initiatives. Educators can also use our results to explore competency gaps and refine curricula for burgeoning training programs. The findings of this study can serve as a springboard for other LMICs to assess the effects of a well-trained eHealth workforce on the return on eHealth investments."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included"""", """"Monique""""=>""""Included""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong study design"",10.1186/s12960-018-0330-8,""Capacity Building",Developing Countries,*Evaluation Studies as Topic,Female,Ghana,*Health Resources,*Health Workforce,Hospitals,

However, comparatively little attention has been paid to the fact that these methods of delivering health care situate Health Information Professionals (HIPs) in an ethical context that is importantly different from that of traditional health care because they assign a fiduciary role to HIPs that they did not have before, their previous technical involvement notwithstanding. Even less attention has been paid to the fact that when these methods of health care delivery are interjurisdictional, they situate HIPs in an ethical fabric that does not exist in the intra-jurisdictional setting. METHOD: Privacy and other informatic patient rights in the context of traditional health care are identified and the role that HIPs play in this connection is analysed and distinguished from the role HIPs play in eHealth in order to determine whether the 2002 IMIA Code of Ethics provides sufficient guidance for HIPs in eHealth and associated settings. The position of inter-jurisdictional corporate eHealth providers is also touched upon. RESULTS: It is found that in eHealth, mHealth and pHealth the ethical and legal position of HIPs differs importantly from that in traditional technologically-assisted health care because HIPs have fiduciary obligations they did not have before. It is also found that the 2002 IMIA Code of Ethics, which provides the framework for the codes of ethics that are promulgated by its various member organizations, provides insufficient guidance for dealing with issues that arise in this connection because they do not acknowledge this important change. It is also found that interjurisdictional eHealth etc. raises new ethical and legal issues for the corporate sector that transcend contractual arrangements. CONCLUSION: The 2002 IMIA Code of Ethics should be revised and updated to provide guidance for HIPs who are engaged in eHealth and related methods of health care delivery, and to provide a model for a corresponding up-to-date revision of the ethical guidelines that are promulgated by IMIA's member organizations. Similar steps should be taken in the corporate sector so that the ethical rules that govern the working environment of HIPs in the eHealth setting will not pose ethical and professional problems.

By conducting 39 semi-structured interviews with academic scholars in both Switzerland and United States, our research aims at exploring the code of ethics and research practices of academic scholars involved in Big Data studies in the fields of psychology and sociology to understand if the principles set by the Belmont Report are still considered relevant in Big Data research. Our study shows how scholars generally find traditional principles to be a suitable guide to perform ethical data research but, at the same time, they recognized and elaborated on the challenges embedded in their practical application. In addition, due to the growing introduction of new actors in scholarly research, such as data holders and owners, it was also questioned whether responsibility to protect research participants should fall solely on investigators. In order to appropriately address ethics issues in Big Data research projects, education in ethics, exchange and dialogue between research teams and scholars from different disciplines should be enhanced. In addition, models of consultancy and shared responsibility between investigators, data owners and review boards should be implemented in order to ensure better protection of research participants."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pone.0241865,""Adult",Behavioral Sciences/*ethics,Big Data,Data Mining/*ethics,Data Science/*ethics,"Ethics, Research",Female,Humans,

METHODS: We implemented a literature-validated questionnaire to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the target population during the period between April and August 2023. Themes of ethical debate included privacy breaches, consent, ownership, augmented biases, epistemology, and accountability. Participants' responses were showcased using descriptive statistics and compared between groups using t-test or ANOVA. RESULTS: We included 466 participants. The greater majority of respondents were interns and residents (50.2%), followed by medical students (38.0%). Most participants were affiliated with university institutions (62.4%). In terms of privacy, participants acknowledged that Big Data and AI were susceptible to privacy breaches (39.3%)"," however, 59.0% found such breaches justifiable under certain conditions. For ethical debacles involving informed consent, 41.6% and 44.6% were aware that obtaining informed consent posed an ethical limitation in Big Data and AI applications and denounced the concept of """"broad consent"""", respectively. In terms of ownership, 49.6% acknowledged that data cannot be owned yet accepted that institutions could hold a quasi-control of such data (59.0%). Less than 50% of participants were aware of Big Data and AI's abilities to augment or create new biases in healthcare. Furthermore, participants agreed that researchers, institutions, and legislative bodies were responsible for ensuring the ethical implementation of Big Data and AI. Finally, while demonstrating limited experience with using such technology, participants generally had positive views of the role of Big Data and AI in complementing healthcare. CONCLUSION: Jordanian medical students, physicians in training and senior practitioners have limited awareness of the ethical risks associated with Big Data and AI.

However, collecting and processing patient data raises new ethical issues regarding patient's rights, social justice and trust in public institutions. The aim of this empirical study is to gain an in-depth understanding of the awareness of possible ethical risks and corresponding obligations among those who are involved in projects using patient data, i.e. healthcare professionals, regulators and policy makers. METHODS: We used a qualitative design to examine Swiss healthcare stakeholders' experiences and perceptions of ethical challenges with regard to patient data in real-life settings where clinical registries are sponsored, created and/or used. A semi-structured interview was carried out with 22 participants (11 physicians, 7 policy-makers, 4 ethical committee members) between July 2014 and January 2015. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using a thematic method derived from Grounded Theory. RESULTS: All interviewees were concerned as a matter of priority with the needs of legal and operating norms for the collection and use of data, whereas less interest was shown in issues regarding patient agency, the need for reciprocity, and shared governance in the management and use of clinical registries' patient data. This observed asymmetry highlights a possible tension between public and research interests on the one hand, and the recognition of patients' rights and citizens' involvement on the other. CONCLUSIONS: The advocation of further health-related data sharing on the grounds of research and public interest, without due regard for the perspective of patients and donors, could run the risk of fostering distrust towards healthcare data collections. Ultimately, this could diminish the expected social benefits. However, rather than setting patient rights against public interest, new ethical approaches could strengthen both concurrently. On a normative level, this study thus provides material from which to develop further ethical reflection towards a more cooperative approach involving patients and citizens in the governance of their health-related big data."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12910-018-0261-x,""Administrative Personnel/*ethics",Adult,Aged,*Awareness,Big Data,*Community Participation,Datasets as Topic/*ethics,Female,

The complex situation of the COVID-19 pandemic was a probable predictor of breaching confidentiality. This study aimed to assess the viewpoints of COVID-19-confirmed patients, who were hospitalized, and their healthcare providers about the compliance of different aspects of patient's privacy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 3433 COVID-19-confirmed patients who were hospitalized in Kerman, between 2020 and 2021, and about 1228 related physicians, nurses, and paraclinical staff. Two separate validated researcher-made questionnaires were developed, each including subscales for physical, informational, and spatial privacy, as well as a satisfaction rate of privacy protection. The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 26, with independent samples t test, Mann-Whitney-U, Kruskal Wallis, and Multiple Linear Regression tests at a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The mean percentages of the patients' privacy scores in physical, spatial, and informational areas were significantly lower (P<0.001) than the average of the medical staff's scores in all three areas (Difference: 10.27%, 14.83%, and 4.91%, respectively). Physical and spatial privacy scores could be predicted based on the participants' classification, patients or medical staff, and sex. The mean patients' satisfaction score was 9.25% lower than the medical staff's (P<0.001). Moreover, only academic hospitals showed a statistically significant difference between the patient's satisfaction with privacy protection and medical staff's viewpoints (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Although this study indicated the benefits of protecting patients' privacy in the healthcare setting, patients' privacy scores and satisfaction were lower than their healthcare providers. The pandemic conditions might have been an obstacle to preserving patients' rights. These findings demonstrated the importance of sensitizing healthcare providers to manage these ethical challenges in a complicated critical state such as the COVID-19 pandemic."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.30476/ijms.2023.97795.3070,Humans",*COVID-19/epidemiology,Iran,Cross-Sectional Studies,Male,Female,*Privacy,Adult,

The use of health IT to apply safety science principles (e.g., standardization) to L&D unit processes may further advance perinatal safety. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with L&D units participating in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ's) Safety Program for Perinatal Care (SPPC) to assess units' experience with program implementation. Analysis of interview transcripts was used to characterize the process and experience of using health IT for applying safety science principles to L&D unit processes. RESULTS: Forty-six L&D units from 10 states completed participation in SPPC program implementation"," thirty-two (70%) reported the use of health IT as an enabling strategy for their local implementation. Health IT was used to improve standardization of processes, use of independent checks, and to facilitate learning from defects. L&D units standardized care processes through use of electronic health record (EHR)-based order sets and use of smart pumps and other technology to improve medication safety. Units also standardized EHR documentation, particularly related to electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) and shoulder dystocia. Cognitive aids and tools were integrated into EHR and care workflows to create independent checks such as checklists, risk assessments, and communication handoff tools. Units also used data from EHRs to monitor processes of care to learn from defects. Units experienced several challenges incorporating health IT, including obtaining organization approval, working with their busy IT departments, and retrieving standardized data from health IT systems. CONCLUSIONS: Use of health IT played an integral part in the planning and implementation of SPPC for participating L&D units. Use of health IT is an encouraging approach for incorporating safety science principles into care to improve perinatal safety and should be incorporated into materials to facilitate the implementation of perinatal safety initiatives."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-017-0572-8,""Adult","*Delivery, Obstetric/standards",Female,"*Hospitals, Maternity/standards",Humans,"Labor, Obstetric",Medical Informatics/*methods,

We assess medical doctors' ethical stance in situations that arise in adopting an AI-enabled Clinical Decision Support System (AI-CDSS) for antibiotic prescribing decision support in a healthcare institution in Singapore. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 doctors of varying medical specialties and designations between October 2022 and January 2023. Our interview guide was anchored on the four pillars of medical ethics. We used clinical vignettes with the following hypothetical scenarios: (1) Using an antibiotic AI-enabled CDSS's recommendations for a tourist, (2) Uncertainty about the AI-CDSS's recommendation of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic vs. concerns about antimicrobial resistance, (3) Patient refusing the """"best treatment"""" recommended by the AI-CDSS, (4) Data breach. RESULTS: More than half of the participants only realized that the AI-enabled CDSS could have misrepresented non-local populations after being probed to think about the AI-CDSS's data source. Regarding prescribing a broad- or narrow-spectrum antibiotic, most participants preferred to exercise their clinical judgment over the AI-enabled CDSS's recommendations in their patients' best interest. Two-thirds of participants prioritized beneficence over patient autonomy by convincing patients who refused the best practice treatment to accept it. Many were unaware of the implications of data breaches.

This study aims to explore healthcare professionals' perspectives on the ethical implications of using AI-CDSS for healthcare resource allocation. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 23 healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, administrators, and medical ethicists in Turkey. Interviews focused on participants' views regarding the use of AI-CDSS in resource allocation, potential ethical challenges, and recommendations for responsible implementation. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participant responses are clustered around five pre-determined thematic areas: (1) balancing efficiency and equity in resource allocation, (2) the importance of transparency and explicability in AI-CDSS, (3) shifting roles and responsibilities in clinical decision-making, (4) ethical considerations in data usage and algorithm development, and (5) balancing cost-effectiveness and patient-centered care.

However, traditional medical education has yet to fully integrate training on managing health-related information, resulting in a significant skills gap among medical and research professionals. This gap is pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where data privacy concerns and inadequate infrastructure hinder efforts to utilise and share health data. AIMS: To address this gap, we developed an online, modular course aimed at providing foundational skills on capturing, storing and sharing health data. METHODS: The course was developed using the ADDIE(Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) instructional design model. A needs assessment workshop involving 25 global health proffesionals identified key training gaps which informed the curriculum's development. A multidisciplinary team from six institutions developed the modules. The course was piloted in a face-to-face setting with 37 participants and later adapted for online delivery via the Global Health Network platform. We evaluated the course using Level 1 of Kirkpatrick's model for training evaluation. RESULTS: Six foundational modules were developed: Introduction to Data Management, Data Quality, Data Repositories, Ethics of Data Sharing, Data Governance, and Costing for Data Management. Between December 2020 and April 2024, 6,384 individuals from 90 countries completed the course.

Summative evaluations, based on voluntary post-module surveys, demonstrated high relevance to participants' learning needs (96.6%) and strong intentions to apply the skills gained (88.3%). Key motivators for enrollment included the course's free access, relevance to professional or academic needs, and trust in the organizations and authors behind the content. CONCLUSIONS: The high enrolment and broad geographical reach demonstrates the potential of online training as a cost-effective tool to equip health practitioners and researchers with data literacy skills. Future evaluations will assess its impact on participants' knowledge, behavior, and data-sharing and reuse practices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12909-024-06405-y,""Humans",*Curriculum,*Health Personnel/education,Research Personnel/education,Data Management,"Education, Distance","Developing Countries"",39614233,PMC11607898",,

This results to patients' and healthcare providers' skepticism to adopt Health Information Technologies (HIT). In Europe, this shortcoming hampers efficient cross-border health data exchange, which requires a holistic, secure and interoperable framework. This study aimed to provide the foundations for designing a secure and interoperable toolkit for cross-border health data exchange within the European Union (EU), conducted in the scope of the KONFIDO project. Particularly, we present our user requirements engineering methodology and the obtained results, driving the technical design of the KONFIDO toolkit. METHODS: Our methodology relied on four pillars: (a) a gap analysis study, reviewing a range of relevant projects/initiatives, technologies as well as cybersecurity strategies for HIT interoperability and cybersecurity", (b) the definition of user scenarios with major focus on cross-border health data exchange in the three pilot countries of the project," (c) a user requirements elicitation phase containing a threat analysis of the business processes entailed in the user scenarios, and (d) surveying and discussing with key stakeholders, aiming to validate the obtained outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators for HIT adoption linked with cybersecurity and interoperability. RESULTS: According to the gap analysis outcomes, full adherence with information security standards is currently not universally met. Sustainability plans shall be defined for adapting existing/evolving frameworks to the state-of-the-art. Overall, lack of integration in a holistic security approach was clearly identified. For each user scenario, we concluded with a comprehensive workflow, highlighting challenges and open issues for their application in our pilot sites. The threat analysis resulted in a set of 30 user goals in total, documented in detail. Finally, indicative barriers of HIT acceptance include lack of awareness regarding HIT risks and legislations, lack of a security-oriented culture and management commitment, as well as usability constraints, while important facilitators concern the adoption of standards and current efforts for a common EU legislation framework. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides important insights to address secure and interoperable health data exchange, while our methodological framework constitutes a paradigm for investigating diverse cybersecurity-related risks in the health sector."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-018-0664-0,Computer Security",Data Collection,Europe,Humans,Medical Informatics/*organization & administration,"Workflow,30326890,PMC6192123",

Healthcare professionals' experiences from rheumatology care.,2020,12,1,BMC health services research,1472-6963 (Electronic),20,1,1108,Granström E and Wannheden C and Brommels M and Hvitfeldt H and Nyström ME,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33261602/,eng,,England,""BACKGROUND: Person-centered care (PCC) emphasize the importance of supporting individuals' involvement in care provided and self-care. PCC has become more important in chronic care as the number of people living with chronic conditions is increasing due to the demographic changes. Digital tools have potential to support interaction between patients and healthcare providers, but empirical examples of how to achieve PCC in chronic care and the role of digital tools in this process is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate strategies to achieve PCC used by the healthcare professionals at an outpatient Rheumatology clinic (RC), the strategies' relation to digital tools, and the perceived impact of the strategies on healthcare professionals and patients. METHODS: A single case study design was used. The qualitative data consisted of 14 semi-structured interviews and staff meeting minutes, covering the time period 2017-2019. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis, complemented with document analyses. RESULTS: Ten strategies on two levels to operationalize PCC, and three categories of perceived impact were identified. On the individual patient level strategies involved several digital tools focusing on flexible access to care, mutual information sharing and the distribution of initiatives, tasks, and responsibilities from provider to patients. On the unit level, strategies concerned involving patient representatives and individual patients in development of digital services and work practices. The roles of both professionals and patients were affected and the importance of behavioral and cultural change became clear. CONCLUSIONS: By providing an empirical example from chronic care the study contributes to the knowledge on strategies for achieving PCC, how digital tools and work practices interact, and how they can affect healthcare staff, patients and the unit. A conclusion is that the use of the digital tools, spanning over different dimensions of engagement, facilitated the healthcare professionals' interaction with patients and the patients' involvement in their own care.

This new domain, often termed 'digital health', has the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes and global health equity more broadly. However, its effective implementation and responsible use are contingent on building a health workforce with a sufficient level of knowledge and skills to effectively navigate the digital transformations in health. More specifically, the next generation of health professionals-namely youth-must be adequately prepared to maximise the potential of these digital transformations. In this commentary, we highlight three priority areas which should be prioritised in digital education to realise the benefits of digital health: capacity building, opportunities for youth, and an ethics-driven approach. Firstly, capacity building requires educational frameworks and curricula to not only be updated, but to also place an emphasis on interdisciplinary learning. Secondly, opportunities are important for youth to meaningfully participate in decision-making processes and gain invaluable practical experiences. Thirdly, training in digital ethics and the responsible use of data as a standard component of education will help to safeguard against potential future inequities resulting from the implementation and use of digital health technologies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12960-021-00591-2,Adolescent",Capacity Building,*Curriculum,*Health Personnel/education,Health Workforce,Humans,"Learning,33853625,PMC8045994",,

METHODS: An online best-worst scaling survey was conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom to ascertain the relative importance of twenty-four DHT attributes among stakeholder groups using an efficient incomplete block design. The attributes were identified from a systematic review of DHT evaluation frameworks for consideration in a health technology assessment. Results were analyzed with multinomial models by stakeholder group and latent class. RESULTS: A total of 1,251 participants completed the survey (576 general community members, 543 patients/carers, and 132 health professionals). Twelve attributes achieved a preference score above 50 percent in the stakeholder group model, predominantly related to safety but also covering technical features, effectiveness, ethics, and economics. Results from the latent class model supported this prioritization.

They need support from third parties, who should ideally respect their autonomy and independence as much as possible. Supporting people with dementia can be very burdensome for caregivers and numbers of patients increase while numbers of potential caregivers decline. Digital assistive technologies (DATs) that directly support patients or their caregivers may help bridging the increasing gap between need of support and available resources. DATs have the potential to preserve the autonomy and independence of people with dementia and promote their abilities, if they are properly designed in close interaction with future users. In our study, we focused on ethical concerns, technological requirements, and implementation criteria for DAT in general and specifically to support outdoor mobility of people with dementia. METHODS: We applied a qualitative approach and conducted a World Café (2 tables, n = 7) and an online focus group (n = 6) with people with dementia, relatives, healthcare professionals, scientists, ethics experts, and experts for digitally-assisted medical care. We descriptively analyzed the data using a content analysis approach. RESULTS: The participants reported technological (e.g., lack of Wi-Fi), financial (e.g., expensive devices or lack of budget for DATs), political (e.g., legal hurdles such as the European Medical Device Law or data protection regulations) as well as user-related hurdles (e.g., lack of digital competence) for the implementation of DAT in dementia care. Among the issues discussed were the importance of autonomy, independence, safety, privacy, and questions of decision making capacity in DAT's use. Participants identified opportunities and benefits in self-learning, situation-aware DATs and wished for dementia-friendly communities. They emphasized the value of personal interaction that should not be replaced, but rather supported by DAT. CONCLUSION: The results revealed multiple hurdles and ethical concerns for DAT use and provided recommendations for designing and implementing DATs. Further investigations are needed on the impact of DAT on personal interactions in caregiving and the role of DAT in dementia-friendly communities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12910-024-01080-6,Humans",*Dementia/therapy,*Self-Help Devices/ethics,*Qualitative Research,*Personal Autonomy,*Caregivers,*Stakeholder Participation,Female,

This review thus explores the areas of ethical debates prompted by CIS conceptualized as smart systems reaching out to patients and citizens. Furthermore, it investigates the ethical competencies and education needed to use these systems appropriately. METHODS: A literature review covering ethics topics in combination with clinical and health information systems, clinical decision support, health information exchange, and various mobile devices and media was performed searching the MEDLINE database for articles from 2016 to 2019 with a focus on 2018 and 2019. A second search combined these keywords with education. RESULTS: By far, most of the discourses were dominated by privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent issues. Intertwined with confidentiality and clear boundaries, the provider-patient relationship has gained much attention. The opacity of algorithms and the lack of explicability of the results pose a further challenge. The necessity of sociotechnical ethics education was underpinned in many studies including advocating education for providers and patients alike. However, only a few publications expanded on ethical competencies. In the publications found, empirical research designs were employed to capture the stakeholders' attitudes, but not to evaluate specific implementations. CONCLUSION: Despite the broad discourses, ethical values have not yet found their firm place in empirically rigorous health technology evaluation studies. Similarly, sociotechnical ethics competencies obviously need detailed specifications.

However, reflection on their clinical implementation reveals a wide array of ethical challenges. The preferences, concerns and expectations of professional stakeholders remain largely unexplored. Empirical research, however, may help to clarify the conceptual debate and its aspects in terms of their relevance for clinical practice. This study explores, from an ethical point of view, future healthcare professionals' attitudes to potential changes of responsibility and decision-making authority when using ML-CDSS. Twenty-seven semistructured interviews were conducted with German medical students and nursing trainees. The data were analysed based on qualitative content analysis according to Kuckartz. Interviewees' reflections are presented under three themes the interviewees describe as closely related: (self-)attribution of responsibility, decision-making authority and need of (professional) experience. The results illustrate the conceptual interconnectedness of professional responsibility and its structural and epistemic preconditions to be able to fulfil clinicians' responsibility in a meaningful manner. The study also sheds light on the four relata of responsibility understood as a relational concept.

Whilst the fundamental drivers to ensure that data access is ethical and satisfies privacy requirements are similar, they are often dealt with in varying ways by different approval processes. OBJECTIVE: To achieve a consensus across an international panel of health care and informatics professionals on an integrated set of privacy and ethics principles that could accelerate health data access in data-driven health research projects. METHOD: A three-round consensus development process was used. In round one, we developed a baseline framework for privacy, ethics, and data access based on a review of existing literature in the health, informatics, and policy domains. This was further developed using a two-round Delphi consensus building process involving 20 experts who were members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI) Primary Health Care Informatics Working Groups. To achieve consensus we required an extended Delphi process. RESULTS: The first round involved feedback on and development of the baseline framework. This consisted of four components: (1) ethical principles, (2) ethical guidance questions, (3) privacy and data access principles, and (4) privacy and data access guidance questions. Round two developed consensus in key areas of the revised framework, allowing the building of a newly, more detailed and descriptive framework. In the final round panel experts expressed their opinions, either as agreements or disagreements, on the ethics and privacy statements of the framework finding some of the previous round disagreements to be surprising in view of established ethical principles. CONCLUSION: This study develops a framework for an integrated approach to ethics and privacy. Privacy breech risk should not be considered in isolation but instead balanced by potential ethical benefit."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.15265/IY-2016-035,""Bioethics",*Confidentiality,Consensus,Delphi Technique,Humans,"Medical Records Systems, Computerized/*ethics/organization & administration"",27830242,PMC5171555",,,

METHODS: We defined data curation as the process of management of data throughout its lifecycle to ensure it can be used into the future. We used a literature review and Delphi exercises to capture insights from the Primary Care Informatics Working Group (PCIWG) of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). RESULTS: We created six recommendations: (1) Ensure consent and formal process to govern access and sharing throughout the data life cycle", (2) Sustainable data creation/collection requires trust and permission, (3) Pay attention to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as they may have unrecognised risks, (4) Integrate data governance and data quality management to support clinical practice in integrated care systems, (5) Recognise the need for new processes to address the ethical issues arising from AI in primary care," (6) Apply an ethical framework mapped to the data life cycle, including an assessment of data quality to achieve effective data curation.

As older persons live longer and increase in number, society faces a greater disease burden and, in public welfare, a corresponding resource deficit. New technology is one solution to this deficit but there is scarce knowledge about ethical aspects of such innovations in care practices. In CARING FUTURES, we address this scarcity by interrogating how new technology in care can become ethically sound and, correspondingly, how ethics of care can become more technology aware. Our concern is to protect quality care for the future. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: CARING FUTURES advances transdisciplinarity through knowledge exchange around technology-mediated care and ethics of care, involving key stakeholders. We rely on established and innovative methods to generate experience-near and practice-near knowledge. Through this empirical research, we seek to expand understanding of technology-mediated care and to enrich ethics of care theory. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Empirical studies have been approved or await approval by national ethics committees. CARING FUTURES is designed to create societal impact through Knowledge Transfer Events targeting stakeholders in health, care and welfare, and Educational Packages for students of care-providing knowledge-exchange forums for future academics and practitioners of care. The project's societal impact is also ensured in that participating researchers are also practitioners and/or educators of care personnel for the future.

A recent systematic review highlighted a dearth of educational interventions (n = 2) to equip professionals to provide supportive care to families when a parent has cancer. Addressing an evident gap in education, this paper details the adaption and optimisation of a face-to-face educational intervention to an accessible eLearning resource. METHODS: Guided by the 'Person-based Approach', a theory-driven and evidence-based face-to-face educational intervention was adapted and optimised as an eLearning resource. This incorporated current evidence, alongside insights from an expert group, learning technologists and research team, leading to the design of an eLearning prototype. This was optimised for acceptability and usability using think-aloud interviews with end-users (n = 13) and patient and public involvement (n = 4). RESULTS: An iterative adaption and optimisation process enabled implementation of navigational improvements, changes to enhance clarity on language and appropriateness of images and interactive components. During optimisation, positive feedback was reported"," especially regarding the 'look and feel' and on the educational videos and reflective exercises embedded throughout the eLearning resource. CONCLUSION: The systematic adaption and optimisation of this novel eLearning resource has aimed to promote relevance, appropriateness, and applicability of an accessible evidence-based and theory-driven training resource for professionals. It has the potential to promote family-centred supportive end of life cancer care, which ultimately can promote better bereavement outcomes.

Many effects in medicine require long periods of time to become traceable e.g. the development of secondary malignancies based on a given radiotherapeutic treatment of the primary disease. Nevertheless, long-term studies often suffer from an initial lack of available information, thus disallowing a standardized approach for their approval by the ethics committee. This is due to several factors, such as the lack of existing case report forms or an explorative research approach in which data elements may change over time. In connection with current medical research and the ongoing digitalization in medicine, Long Term Medical Data Registries (MDR-LT) have become an important means of collecting and analyzing study data. As with any clinical study, ethical aspects must be taken into account when setting up such registries. This work addresses the problem of creating a valid, high-quality ethics committee proposal for medical registries by suggesting groups of tasks (building blocks), information sources and appropriate methods for collecting and analyzing the information, as well as a process model to compile an ethics committee proposal (EsPRit). METHODS: To derive the building blocks and associated methods software and requirements engineering approaches were utilized. Furthermore, a process-oriented approach was chosen, as information required in the creating process of ethics committee proposals remain unknown in the beginning of planning an MDR-LT. Here, we derived the needed steps from medical product certification. This was done as the medical product certification itself also communicates a process-oriented approach rather than merely focusing on content. A proposal was created for validation and inspection of applicability by using the proposed building blocks. The proposed best practice was tested and refined within SEMPER (Secondary Malignoma - Prospective Evaluation of the Radiotherapeutics dose distribution as the cause for induction) as a case study. RESULTS: The proposed building blocks cover the topics of """"Context Analysis"""", """"Requirements Analysis"""", """"Requirements Validation"""", """"Electronic Case Report (eCRF) Design"""" and """"Overall Concept Creation"""". Additional methods are attached with regards to each topic. The goals of each block can be met by applying those methods. The proposed methods are proven methods as applied in e.g. existing Medical Data Registry projects, as well as in software or requirements engineering. CONCLUSION: Several building blocks and attached methods could be identified in the creation of a generic ethics committee proposal. Hence, an Ethics Committee can make informed decisions on the suggested study via said blocks, using the suggested methods such as """"Defining Clinical Questions"""" within the Context Analysis. The study creators have to confirm that they adhere to the proposed procedure within the ethic proposal statement. Additional existing Medical Data Registry projects can be compared to EsPRit for conformity to the proposed procedure. This allows for the identification of gaps, which can lead to amendments requested by the ethics committee."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-017-0539-9,Biomedical Research/*standards",Ethics Committees/*standards,Health Information Systems/*standards,Humans,"Registries/*standards,29047394,PMC5648439",,,,

For this change and adaptation, it is necessary to determine the innovative work behavior perception of healthcare professionals. This study aims to examine the relationship between healthcare professionals' innovative work behavior perceptions and metaverse knowledge and awareness levels together with demographic characteristics. METHODS: In the study, a quantitative research method was applied using the Metaverse (MS) Scale and Innovative Work Behavior (IWB) Scale, and the subject was examined with structural equation modeling. An online questionnaire prepared via Google Forms was applied to 253 healthcare professionals university graduated residing in Istanbul who accepted to participate in the survey voluntarily through snowball sampling. The responses obtained from the participants in the study were analyzed with SPSS for Windows 29.0 and AMOS 25.0 package programs. Discriminant validity analysis was performed between the variables and it was investigated whether the separation between the variables was sufficient for structural equation modeling. The effect of demographic characteristics on the IWB scale and the effect of IWB scale sub-dimensions on the MS scale sub-dimensions were investigated.

Decision support systems (DSS), e.g., prognostic calculators, can aid oncologists' decision-making. DSS that contain features tailored to the needs of oncologists are more likely to be implemented in clinical practice. Therefore, our aim is to inventory colorectal cancer specialists' unmet decision support needs. METHODS: We asked oncologists from the Dutch colorectal cancer group (DCCG), to participate in an online inventory questionnaire on their unmet decision support needs. To get more in-depth insight in required features of the DSS they need, we also conducted semi-structured telephone interviews. RESULTS: Forty-one oncologists started the inventory questionnaire, and 27 of them completed all items. Of all respondents, 18 were surgeons (44%), 22 were medical oncologists (54%), and 28 (68%) had more than 10 years of experience treating mCRC. In both the inventory questionnaire and interviews, respondents expressed a need for an overarching DSS incorporating multiple treatment options, and presenting both the treatment benefits and harms. Respondents found it relevant for other outcomes, such as cost-effectiveness of treatment or quality of life, to be incorporated in DSS. There was also a wish for DSS incorporating an up-to-date """"personalized"""" overview of the ongoing trials for which a specific patient is eligible. CONCLUSIONS: Experienced oncologists indicate that their treatment advice is currently almost solely based on the available clinical guidelines. They experience a lack of good quality DSS to help them personalize their treatment advice. New tools integrating multiple treatment options and providing a broad range of clinically relevant outcomes are urgently needed to stimulate and safeguard more personalized treatment decision-making."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-018-0712-9,""Adult",*Clinical Decision-Making,Colorectal Neoplasms/secondary/*therapy,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",Humans,*Oncologists,*Palliative Care,"Surveys and Questionnaires"",30551735,PMC6295030",

This emphasizes the need to adopt collaborative health care practices, which implies collaboration among interprofessional health care teams and patients, their families, caregivers, and communities. In recent years, digital health technologies that support self-care and collaboration between the community and health care providers (ie, participatory health technologies) have received increasing attention. However, knowledge regarding the features of such technologies that support effective patient-professional partnerships is still limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to map and assess published studies on participatory health technologies intended to support partnerships among patients, caregivers, and health care professionals in chronic care, focusing specifically on identifying the main features of these technologies. METHODS: A scoping review covering scientific publications in English between January 2008 and December 2020 was performed. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases. Peer-reviewed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies that evaluated digital health technologies for patient-professional partnerships in chronic care settings were included. The data were charted and analyzed thematically. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist was used. RESULTS: This review included 32 studies, reported in 34 papers. The topic of participatory health technologies experienced a slightly increasing trend across publication years, with most papers originating from the United States and Norway. Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were the most common conditions addressed. Of the 32 studies, 12 (38%) evaluated the influence of participatory health technologies on partnerships, mostly with positive outcomes, although we also identified how partnership relationships and the nature of collaborative work could be challenged when the roles and expectations between users were unclear. Six common features of participatory health technologies were identified: patient-professional communication, self-monitoring, tailored self-care support, self-care education, care planning, and community forums for peer-to-peer interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the importance of clarifying mutual expectations and carefully considering the implications that the introduction of participatory health technologies may have on the work of patients and health care professionals, both individually and in collaboration.

There are also growing concerns about unprofessional behaviors and blurring of professional identities that are undermining digital professionalism. This review tapped the literature to determine the impact of social media on medical professionalism and how can professional identities and values be maintained in digital era. METHODS: We searched the databases of PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and EBSCO host using (professionalism AND (professionalism OR (professional identity) OR (professional behaviors) OR (professional values) OR (professional ethics))) AND ((social media) AND ((social media) OR (social networking sites) OR Twitter OR Facebook)) AND (health professionals). The research questions were based on sample (health professionals), phenomenon of interest (digital professionalism), design, evaluation and research type. We screened initial yield of titles using pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria and selected a group of articles for qualitative analysis. We used the Biblioshiny® software package for the generation of popular concepts as clustered keywords. RESULTS: Our search yielded 44 articles with four leading themes"," marked rise in the use of social media by healthcare professionals and students, negative impact of social media on digital professionalism, blurring of medical professional values, behaviors, and identity in the digital era, and limited evidence for teaching and assessing digital professionalism. A high occurrence of violation of patient privacy, professional integrity and cyberbullying were identified. Our search revealed a paucity of existing guidelines and policies for digital professionalism that can safeguard healthcare professionals, students and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review reports a significant rise of unprofessional behaviors in social media among healthcare professionals. We could not identify the desired professional behaviors and values essential for digital identity formation. The boundaries between personal and professional practices are mystified in digital professionalism.

Research has raised many ethical considerations respecting clinical applications of artificial intelligence, and it has identified a role for professional regulation in helping to guide practitioners in the ethical use of technology"," however, regulation in this area has been slow to develop. This study seeks to identify the challenges that health professionals face in the context of technological change, and whether regulators' codes of ethics and guidance are sufficient to help workers navigate these changes. METHODS: We conducted mixed methods research in Ontario, Canada, using qualitative content analysis of regulators' codes of ethics and practice guidance (26 regulators, 63 documents analysed), interviews with 7 representatives from 5 health profession regulatory bodies, and focus groups with 17 healthcare practitioners across 5 professions in the province. We used thematic analysis to analyse the data and answer our core research questions. RESULTS: We find that codes of ethics focus more on general principles and managing practitioners' relationships with clients/patients"," hence, it is not clear that these documents can successfully guide professional practice in a context of rapid technological change. Practitioners and regulatory body staff express ambivalence and uncertainty about regulators' roles in regulating technology use. In some instances, health professionals experience conflict between the expectations of their regulator and their employer. These gaps and conflicts leave some professionals uncertain about how to practice ethically in a digital age.

Its intent is that participants enter research voluntarily, with an understanding of what their participation entails. Despite agreement on the necessity to obtain informed consent in research, opinions vary on the threshold of disclosure necessary and the best method to obtain consent. We aimed to investigate Australian researchers' views on, and their experiences with, obtaining informed consent. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 researchers from NSW institutions, working in various fields of research. Interviews were analysed and coded to identify themes. RESULTS: Researchers reported that consent involved information disclosure, understanding and a voluntary decision. They emphasised the variability of consent interactions, which were dependent on potential participants' abilities and interests, study complexity and context. All researchers reported providing written information to potential participants, yet questioned the readability and utility of this information. The majority reported using signed consent forms to 'operationalise' consent and reported little awareness of, and lack of support in implementing more dynamic informed consent procedures, such as verbal informed consent, that was fit for the purposes of their studies. Views on Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs) varied. Some reported inconsistent, arduous inputs on the information form and consent process. Others expressed reliance on HRECs for guidance, viewing them as institutional safeguards. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of transparent relationships, both between researchers and participants, and between researchers and HRECs. Where the relationship with study participants was reported as more robust, researchers felt that they were better able to ensure participants made better, more informed decisions. Where the relationship with HRECs was reported as more robust, researchers were more likely to view them as institutional safeguards, rather than as bureaucratic hindrances. Conscientious and mindful researchers are paramount to ensuring the procedure accommodates individual requirements. This study advocates that when designing ethical informed consent practices, researchers should be integrated as autonomous players with a positive input on the process, rather than, in the worst case, predatory recruiters to be curtailed by information forms and oversight."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12910-020-00538-7,""Australia","Ethics Committees, Research",Humans,*Informed Consent,Qualitative Research,"*Research Personnel"",33008387,PMC7531157",,,

The present study examined the predictors of physicians' stress related to information systems (SRIS) among Finnish physicians. The examined predictors were cognitive workload, staffing problems, time pressure, problems in teamwork and job satisfaction, adjusted for baseline levels of SRIS, age, gender and employment sector. METHODS: The study has a follow-up design with two survey data collection waves, one in 2006 and one in 2015, based on a random sample of Finnish physicians was used. The present study used a sample that included 1109 physicians (61.9% women", mean age in 2015 was 54.5," range 34-72) who provided data on the SRIS in both waves. The effects of a) predictor variable levels in 2006 on SRIS in 2015 and b) the change in the predictor variables from 2006 to 2015 on SRIS in 2015 were analysed with linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that the higher level of cognitive workload in 2006 significantly predicted higher level of SRIS in 2015 (ß = 0.08). The reciprocity of this association was tested with cross-lagged structural equation model analyses which showed that the direction of the association was from cognitive workload to SRIS, not from SRIS to cognitive workload. Moreover, increases in time pressure (ß = 0.16) and problems in teamwork (ß = 0.10) were associated with higher levels of SRIS in 2015, whereas job satisfaction increase was associated with lower SRIS (ß = - 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, physicians' cognitive workload may have long-lasting negative ramifications in regard to how stressful physicians experience their health information systems to be. Thus, organisations should pay attention to physicians workload if they wish physicians to master all the systems they need to use. It is also important to provide physicians with enough time and collegial support in their system-related problems, and in learning new systems and system updates."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-3094-x,""Adult",Aged,Female,Finland,Follow-Up Studies,Forecasting,

Safety work differs from hospital care. The incidence of adverse events in home healthcare is sparsely studied but is estimated to occur in-one third of patients, and most are deemed preventable. Although nursing care is crucial for risk assessment and preventive work in the home environment, the role of registered nurses in the prevention of no-harm incidents and adverse events has not received sufficient scientific attention. OBJECTIVES: To explore nursing-sensitive events in patients receiving home healthcare. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A Swedish national multicenter study based on a structured record review of 600 randomly chosen healthcare records from 10 organizations in different regions of the country. METHODS: Ten trained teams, each including physician(s) and registered nurses, undertook a review based on the Global Trigger Tool method. The review covered a maximum of 90 days from admission to home healthcare. First, each record was screened for the presence of 38 predefined triggers. In the second step, every potential event was assessed according to preventability, types of events, severity, time of occurrence, consequences of the event, and potential contributing causes. RESULTS: In total, 699 events were identified in the study. Of these, 495 (74.0%) were classified as nursing-sensitive (227 no-harm incidents and 268 adverse events) and affected 267 (44.5%) patients, with a mean of 1.9 events per patient. The majority (n = 367, 73.1%) were considered preventable. The most prominent types of nursing-sensitive event were falls (n = 138, 27.9%), pressure ulcers (n = 62, 12.5%), healthcare-associated infections (n = 58, 11.7%) and medication management (n = 50, 10.1%). Concerning severity, 45.9% were classified as no-harm incidents and another 36.6% resulted in temporary harm that required extra healthcare resources: 226 hospital days, 66 physician visits in outpatient care, and 99 in home healthcare. All severity types occurred from day 1, except death, which included only one patient. The most frequent contributing factors were deficiencies in nursing care, treatment & diagnosis, with the subgroups nursing care, observation, treatment & follow-up, followed by deficiencies in the organization. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing-sensitive events in home healthcare are common, often preventable, and occur from the start of the care period.

GoPA! developed standardized country-specific physical activity profiles (""""Country Cards"""") to summarize country-level data through 2013. The aim of this study was to assess use of the Country Cards, identify the factors associated with their use, and develop recommendations for supporting country-level physical activity promotion. METHODS: Cross sectional internet-based survey conducted between August-October 2016. Target study participants were national physical activity leaders and advocates in academia, government and practice from the GoPA! countries, and members of the International Society of Physical Activity and Health. A Country Card use composite score was created based on the diversity and frequency of use. Statistical analyses on the associations between the composite score and respondent characteristics, country characteristics, barriers and opinions were conducted (including descriptive analyses and a logistic regression with robust standard errors). RESULTS: One hundred forty three participants from 68 countries completed the survey. Use of the Country Cards was associated with being part of the GoPA! network, knowing about the Country Cards, and on the stage of country capacity for physical activity promotion. Country Card knowledge varied by country income group, region and the country specific context. More diverse and frequent use of the cards (highest tertile of the composite score for use) was associated with: 1. Being a country contact vs general participant (OR 18.32-95% CI 5.63-59.55, p = 0.002), and 2.

However, the evidence base for most paediatric diagnostic and therapeutic procedures remains limited or is often inferred from adults. There is an urgency to improve paediatric healthcare provision based on real-world evidence generation. Digital transformation is a unique opportunity to shape a data-driven, agile, learning healthcare system and deliver more efficient and personalised care to children and their families. The goal of Paediatric Personalized Research Network Switzerland (SwissPedHealth) is to build a sustainable and scalable infrastructure to make routine clinical data from paediatric hospitals in Switzerland interoperable, standardised, quality-controlled, and ready for observational research, quality assurance, trials and health-policy creation. This study describes the design, aims and current achievements of SwissPedHealth. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SwissPedHealth was started in September 2022 as one of four national data streams co-funded by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) and the Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT). SwissPedHealth develops modular governance and regulatory strategies and harnesses SPHN automatisation procedures in collaboration with clinical data warehouses, the Data Coordination Center, Biomedical Information Technology Network, and other SPHN institutions and funded projects. The SwissPedHealth consortium is led by a multisite, multidisciplinary Steering Committee, incorporating patient and family representatives. The data stream contains work packages focusing on (1) governance and implementation of standardised data collection, (2) nested projects to test the feasibility of the data stream, (3) a lighthouse project that enriches the data stream by integrating multi-omics data, aiming to improve diagnoses of rare diseases and 4) engagement with families through patient and public involvement activities and bioethics interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The health database regulation of SwissPedHealth was approved by the ethics committee (AO_2022-00018). Research findings will be disseminated through national and international conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals, and in lay language via online media and podcasts."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmjopen-2024-091884,""Humans",Switzerland,*Precision Medicine/methods,Child,*Pediatrics/organization & administration,Biomedical Research/organization & administration,"Hospitals, Pediatric/organization & administration"",39725440,PMC11683899",,

The i2b2 platform has several components with numerous dependencies and configuration parameters, which renders the task of installing or upgrading i2b2 a challenging one. Even with the availability of extensive documentation and tutorials, new users often require several weeks to correctly install a functional i2b2 platform. The goal of this work is to simplify the installation and upgrade process for i2b2. Specifically, we have containerized the core components of the platform, and evaluated the containers for ease of installation. RESULTS: We developed three Docker container images: WildFly, database, and web, to encapsulate the three major deployment components of i2b2. These containers isolate the core functionalities of the i2b2 platform, and work in unison to provide its functionalities. Our evaluations indicate that i2b2 containers function successfully on the Linux platform. Our results demonstrate that the containerized components work out-of-the-box, with minimal configuration. CONCLUSIONS: Containerization offers the potential to package the i2b2 platform components into standalone executable packages that are agnostic to the underlying host operating system. By releasing i2b2 as a Docker container, we anticipate that users will be able to create a working i2b2 hive installation without the need to download, compile, and configure individual components that constitute the i2b2 cells, thus making this platform accessible to a greater number of institutions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-018-0646-2,*Biomedical Research",Humans,*Medical Informatics Applications,*Medical Informatics Computing,"*Point-of-Care Systems,30012140,PMC6048900",,,,

These models are increasingly integrated into various applications, including mental health support. However, the credibility of LLMs in providing reliable and explainable mental health information and support remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review systematically maps the factors influencing the credibility of LLMs in mental health support, including reliability, explainability, and ethical considerations. The review is expected to offer critical insights for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers, guiding future research and policy development. These findings will contribute to the responsible integration of LLMs into mental health care, with a focus on maintaining ethical standards and user trust. METHODS: This review follows PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. Eligibility criteria include studies that apply transformer-based generative language models in mental health support, such as BERT and GPT. Sources include PsycINFO, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. A systematic search of studies from 2019 onward will be conducted and updated until October 2024. Data will be synthesized qualitatively. The Population, Concept, and Context framework will guide the inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers will screen and extract data, resolving discrepancies through discussion. Data will be synthesized and presented descriptively. RESULTS: As of September 2024, this study is currently in progress, with the systematic search completed and the screening phase ongoing. We expect to complete data extraction by early November 2024 and synthesis by late November 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review will map the current evidence on the credibility of LLMs in mental health support. It will identify factors influencing the reliability, explainability, and ethical considerations of these models, providing insights for practitioners, researchers, policy makers, and users. These findings will fill a critical gap in the literature and inform future research, practice, and policy development, ensuring the responsible integration of LLMs in mental health services.

To integrate research findings into the policy making process and to communicate research findings to policymakers is a key challenge world-wide. This paper reports the experiences of a research group in a Nigerian university when seeking to 'do' GRIPP, and the important features and challenges of this process within the African context. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with nine purposively selected policy makers in various organizations and six researchers from the universities and research institute in a Nigerian who had been involved in 15 selected joint studies/projects with Health Policy Research Group (HPRG). The interviews explored their understanding and experience of the methods and processes used by the HPRG to generate research questions and research results", their involvement in the process and whether the methods were perceived as effective in relation to influencing policy and practice and factors that influenced the uptake of research results. RESULTS: The results are represented in a model with the four GRIPP strategies found: i) stakeholders' request for evidence to support the use of certain strategies or to scale up health interventions, ii) policymakers and stakeholders seeking evidence from researchers, iii) involving stakeholders in designing research objectives and throughout the research process," and iv) facilitating policy maker-researcher engagement in finding best ways of using research findings to influence policy and practice and to actively disseminate research findings to relevant stakeholders and policymakers. The challenges to research utilization in health policy found were to address the capacity of policy makers to demand and to uptake research, the communication gap between researchers, donors and policymakers, the management of the political process of GRIPP, the lack of willingness of some policy makers to use research, the limited research funding and the resistance to change. CONCLUSIONS: Country based Health Policy and Systems Research groups can influence domestic policy makers if appropriate strategies are employed. The model presented gives some direction to potential strategies for getting research into policy and practice in the health care sector in Nigeria and elsewhere."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12992-016-0209-1,Administrative Personnel/*psychology/standards",Evidence-Based Practice,Health Policy/trends,Humans,

METHODS: We developed four overarching issues to use as a starting point for developing an ethical framework for telehealth. We then reviewed telemedicine ethics guidelines elaborated by the American Medical Association (AMA), the World Medical Association (WMA), and the telehealth component of the Health Professions council of South Africa (HPCSA). We then compared these guidelines with practitioner perspectives to identify the similarities and differences between them. Finally, we generated suggestions to bridge the gap between ethics guidelines and the micro level use of telehealth. RESULTS: Clear differences emerged between the ethics guidelines and the practitioner perspectives. The main reason for the differences were the different contexts where telehealth was used, for example, variability in international practice and variations in the complexity of patient-provider interactions. Overall, published guidelines largely focus on macro level issues related to technology and maintaining data security in patient-provider interactions while practitioner concern is focused on applying the guidelines to specific micro level contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Ethics guidelines on telehealth have a macro level focus in contrast to the micro level needs of practitioners. Work is needed to close this gap. We recommend that both telehealth practitioners and ethics guideline developers better understand healthcare systems and adopt a learning health system approach that draws upon different contexts of clinical practice, innovative models of care delivery, emergent data and evidence-based outcomes. This would help develop a clearer set of priorities and guidelines for the ethical conduct of telehealth."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1055/s-0040-1701976,*Attitude of Health Personnel",*Bioethical Issues,Cross-Cultural Comparison,*Guidelines as Topic,Health Services for the Aged/ethics,Humans,Learning Health System,Physicians,

Success in precision medicine depends on the access to healthcare and biomedical data. To this end, the digitization of all clinical exams and medical records is becoming a standard in hospitals. The digitization is essential to collect, share, and aggregate large volumes of heterogeneous data to support the discovery of hidden patterns with the aim to define predictive models for biomedical purposes. Patients' data sharing is a critical process. In fact, it raises ethical, social, legal, and technological issues that must be properly addressed. RESULTS: In this work, we present an infrastructure devised to deal with the integration of large volumes of heterogeneous biological data. The infrastructure was applied to the data collected between 2010-2016 in one of the major diagnostic analysis laboratories in Italy. Data from three different platforms were collected (i.e., laboratory exams, pathological anatomy exams, biopsy exams). The infrastructure has been designed to allow the extraction and aggregation of both unstructured and semi-structured data. Data are properly treated to ensure data security and privacy. Specialized algorithms have also been implemented to process the aggregated information with the aim to obtain a precise historical analysis of the clinical activities of one or more patients. Moreover, three Bayesian classifiers have been developed to analyze examinations reported as free text. Experimental results show that the classifiers exhibit a good accuracy when used to analyze sentences related to the sample location, diseases presence and status of the illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: The infrastructure allows the integration of multiple and heterogeneous sources of anonymized data from the different clinical platforms. Both unstructured and semi-structured data are processed to obtain a precise historical analysis of the clinical activities of one or more patients. Data aggregation allows to perform a series of statistical assessments required to answer complex questions that can be used in a variety of fields, such as predictive and precision medicine. In particular, studying the clinical history of patients that have developed similar pathologies can help to predict or individuate markers able to allow an early diagnosis of possible illnesses."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2300-5,Algorithms",Bayes Theorem,*Big Data,Biopsy,Computer Simulation,*Data Analysis,Humans,Machine Learning,

This study aimed to obtain a clear and comprehensive understanding of the process of death registration of U5M and address the challenges of accurate certification faced by physicians at hospitals and health offices. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was performed by conducting 10 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with physicians who are actively involved in the certification of U5M. Physicians were invited to participate from primary health care units, health offices, district and general hospitals in Cairo, Giza and Assiut Governorates. Field visits of health offices were performed to observe the procedure of death registration, visualize a sample of the hospitals' Death Notification Forms (DNFs) and death certificates of U5M, and explore the used electronic system of death registration. Data analysis was performed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The study clarified the procedure of death certification of U5M, starting from hospitals and ending at health offices. It was evident that there is a considerable deficiency in the system of registration and coding causes of death. Physicians of hospitals had a negative attitude regarding death registration. They were found to have deficient knowledge about standards of death certification. They had difficulty defining and reporting the chain of events leading to death. Poor diagnostic facilities hindered physicians from accurately reporting COD. Fear of legal accountability was a cause of avoiding detailed COD. For physicians in the health offices, other challenges were mentioned such as assigning junior physicians to manage the task of writing DNFs, poor quality of hospital reports and the unrealistic ICD-10 codes. CONCLUSION: Improving the accuracy of writing DNFs in hospitals is essential for providing reliable U5M statistics. Practical training of physicians, especially the junior ones, on ICD-10 classification and on identification and writing direct and indirect COD in the allocated lines in the death certificates is a priority. Establishing an audit system to assess the quality of the process of certification and updating the software of the electronic system for data entry would have a great impact."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-024-11780-9,""*Death Certificates",Humans,Egypt,*Qualitative Research,"Child, Preschool",Focus Groups,Infant,Female,

OBJECTIVE: To explore the needs, opportunities, and challenges involved in continuing professional development for Chinese physicians becoming competent general practitioners within primary care, with a special focus on the possibilities of applying augmented reality. METHODS: This study used a qualitative approach with semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Two managers and thirteen physicians (from four community health centers and stations) participated. The data were analyzed using a thematic inductive analysis approach. RESULTS: Based on our interviews, most of the physicians were not fully trained as general practitioners but still assumed the duties of that position"," they were supposed to eventually become fully trained in line with the reforms of the Chinese primary care system. However, they reported a lack of in-service training opportunities to fulfill this goal. Even those who said that they had such opportunities perceived the efficacy of that training as being poor.

Successful implementation across the health care system depends on conditions and requirements that are often presented to health professionals through text-based materials and might present contradictory expectations to the work of health professionals. In this study, we operationalize institutional context as the text-based material, which from the perspective of health professionals, influence health care work. Via the case of a readmission prevention program for elderly patients, we examine the experiences of health professionals that work with implementation, concerning the contradictions that arise between the demands imposed by program implementation and their everyday work routines, and the role of text-based materials in these contradictions. METHOD: We conducted five focus group interviews among health professionals working at different locations in a single administrative region of Denmark. The 24 health professionals in our study included hospital physicians, hospital nurses, medical secretaries, municipal care managers, registered municipal nurses, and general practitioners. All focus group interviews were transcribed verbatim. Inspired by institutional ethnography, we look into text-based materials, such as written guidelines, if health professionals indicate they are important. RESULTS: The health professionals experience that specific demands of the readmission prevention program come into conflict with the existing demands and daily work routines. Professional resistance to control and the existing digital communication tools create tensions with a program requirement for standardized enrollment of patients to the program. In addition, the striving for autonomy among health professionals and the high level of mono-professional working routines create tension with the program requirements for an additional amount of interdisciplinary work. The different demands are widely mediated by text-based materials such as the existing digital communication tools and the instructions on how to use them, and the official agreement of the role and assignment for Danish GPs. CONCLUSION: Successful implementation of the prevention program is affected by various tensions between the program demands and the existing health care work.

Allow the interchange of information about these assets through the use of specific vocabularies based on the use of ontologies. METHODS: Ontologies are a formal way to represent knowledge by means of triples composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. Given the sensitivity of network assets in health care institutions, this work by using an ontology-based representation of information complies with the FAIR principles. Federated queries to the ontology systems, allow users to obtain data from multiple sources (i.e., several hospitals belonging to the same public body). Therefore, this representation makes it possible for network administrators in health care institutions to have a clear understanding of possible threats that may emerge in the network. RESULTS: As a result of this work, the """"Software Defined Networking Description Language-CUREX Asset Discovery Tool Ontology"""" (SDNDL-CAO) has been developed.

Phenotyping provides real-world evidence for other related biomedical research and clinical tasks, e.g., disease diagnosis, drug development, and clinical trials, etc. With the development of electronic health records, the performance of electronic phenotyping has been significantly boosted by advanced machine learning techniques. In the healthcare domain, precision and fairness are both essential aspects that should be taken into consideration. However, most related efforts are put into designing phenotyping models with higher accuracy. Few attention is put on the fairness perspective of phenotyping. The neglection of bias in phenotyping leads to subgroups of patients being underrepresented which will further affect the following healthcare activities such as patient recruitment in clinical trials. In this work, we are motivated to bridge this gap through a comprehensive experimental study to identify the bias existing in electronic phenotyping models and evaluate the widely-used debiasing methods' performance on these models. We choose pneumonia and sepsis as our phenotyping target diseases. We benchmark 9 kinds of electronic phenotyping methods spanning from rule-based to data-driven methods. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of the 5 bias mitigation strategies covering pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Through the extensive experiments, we summarize several insightful findings from the bias identified in the phenotyping and key points of the bias mitigation strategies in phenotyping."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.jbi.2024.104671,Bias",*Benchmarking,*Data Mining/ethics/standards,*Electronic Health Records,*Algorithms,Pneumonia/diagnosis/epidemiology,Sepsis/diagnosis/epidemiology,Cohort Studies,

Many technological solutions are available to collect and analyse data for cancer registries nowadays. However, the lack of a well-defined common semantic model is a problem when user-defined analyses and data linking to external resources are required. The objectives of this study are: (1) design of a semantic model for local cancer registries", (2) development of a semantically-enabled cancer registry based on this model," and (3) semantic exploitation of the cancer registry for analysing and visualising disease courses. RESULTS: Our proposal is based on our previous results and experience working with semantic technologies. Data stored in a cancer registry database were transformed into RDF employing a process driven by OWL ontologies. The semantic representation of the data was then processed to extract semantic patient profiles, which were exploited by means of SPARQL queries to identify groups of similar patients and to analyse the disease timelines of patients. Based on the requirements analysis, we have produced a draft of an ontology that models the semantics of a local cancer registry in a pragmatic extensible way. We have implemented a Semantic Web platform that allows transforming and storing data from cancer registries in RDF. This platform also permits users to formulate incremental user-defined queries through a graphical user interface. The query results can be displayed in several customisable ways. The complex disease timelines of individual patients can be clearly represented. Different events, e.g. different therapies and disease courses, are presented according to their temporal and causal relations. CONCLUSION: The presented platform is an example of the parallel development of ontologies and applications that take advantage of semantic web technologies in the medical field. The semantic structure of the representation renders it easy to analyse key figures of the patients and their evolution at different granularity levels."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13326-017-0154-9,""*Database Management Systems","Databases, Factual",Humans,Information Storage and Retrieval/methods,Internet,Medical Informatics/methods,

The UAE has experienced unprecedented population growth coupled with increased rates of chronic diseases over the past few decades. Healthcare workers are the core foundation of the health system, especially for chronic care conditions, and the UAE health workforce needs to be fully prepared for the increased rates of chronic diseases in the adult population. Abu Dhabi is the largest emirate in terms of land mass and population size, and the purpose of this paper was to assess how the health system has been using the Chronic Care Model to improve its capacity to reach out to all patients in the population. CASE PRESENTATION: The Abu Dhabi health workforce has twice the number of doctors (52.4 vs. 23.2 per 10 000 population) and nurses (134.7 vs. 50.4 per 10 000 population) compared to the entire UAE health workforce. In addition to an overreliance on expatriate workers, there is an excess of some specializations such as general medicine and gynecology and a severe undersupply of other specialties including trauma and injury, and medical oncology. The digital infrastructure and skills of the health workforce need to be improved to minimize the proportion of the appointment time required to complete administrative tasks for a health insurance system and maximize the doctor-patient face-to-face interaction time for consultation and lifestyle counseling. CONCLUSIONS: A greater emphasis needs to be placed on developing self-management support strategies using a combination of nurse health educators and community-based patient-led health programs. The UAE Vision 2021 includes developing a world-class healthcare system, and full implementation of the Chronic Care Model seems to facilitate the detailed planning and preparation of healthcare services and workers required to achieve this goal."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12960-019-0345-9,Adult",*Capacity Building,Child,Chronic Disease,*Delivery of Health Care,*Developing Countries,Foreign Medical Graduates,*Health Personnel,

Although capacity-building efforts are ongoing, there has been limited attention on the contextual and health system peculiarities in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, given the challenges encountered during the implementation of health interventions, the field of implementation research requires a creative attempt to build expertise for health researchers and practitioners simultaneously. With support from the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, we have developed an implementation research short course that targets both researchers and practitioners. This paper seeks to explain the course development processes and report on training evaluations, highlighting its relevance for inter-institutional and inter-regional capacity strengthening. METHODS: The development of the implementation research course curriculum was categorised into four phases, namely the formation of a core curriculum development team, course content development, internal reviews and pilot, and external reviews and evaluations. Five modules were developed covering Introduction to implementation research, Methods in implementation research, Ethics and quality management in implementation research, Community and stakeholder engagement, and Dissemination in implementation research. Course evaluations were conducted using developed tools measuring participants' reactions and learning. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2018, the IR curriculum has been used to train a total of 165 researchers and practitioners predominantly from African countries, the majority of whom are males (57%) and researchers/academics (79.4%). Participants generally gave positive ratings (e.g. integration of concepts) for their reactions to the training. Under 'learnings', participants indicated improvement in their knowledge in areas such as identification of implementation research problems and questions. CONCLUSION: The approach for training both researchers and practitioners offers a dynamic opportunity for the acquisition and sharing of knowledge for both categories of learners. This approach was crucial in demonstrating a key characteristic of implementation research (e.g. multidisciplinary) practically evident during the training sessions. Using such a model to effectively train participants from various low- and middle-income countries shows the opportunities this training curriculum offers as a capacity-building tool."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12961-020-00568-y,""Africa",*Capacity Building,*Curriculum,Delivery of Health Care,Developing Countries,"Ethics, Research",Female,Health Personnel/*education,

With traditional health care claims verification and reimbursement, the health care provider submits a claim after rendering services to a patient, which is then verified and reimbursed by the payer. However, this process leaves out a critical stakeholder: the patient for whom the services are actually rendered. This lack of patient participation introduces a risk of fraud and abuse. Blockchain technology enables secure data management with transparency, which could mitigate this risk of health care fraud and abuse. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a framework using blockchain to record claims data and transactions in an immutable format and to enable the patient to act as a validating node to help detect and prevent health care fraud and abuse. METHODS: We developed a health care fraud and abuse blockchain technical framework and prototype using key blockchain tools and application layers including consensus algorithms, smart contracts, tokens, and governance based on digital identity on the Ethereum platform (Ethereum Foundation). RESULTS: Our technical framework maps to the claims adjudication process and focuses on Medicare claims, with the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as the central authority. A prototype of the framework system was developed using the blockchain platform Ethereum (Ethereum Foundation), with its design features, workflow, smart contract functions, system architecture, and software implementation outlined.

Although beneficial for the international advancement in building smart environments to transform ICU services, knowledge about the contemporary development of ICIS worldwide, their usage and impacts is limited. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by researching the development and implementation of an ICIS in a Chinese hospital, nurses' use of the system, and the impact of system use on critical care nursing processes and outcomes. METHODS: This descriptive case study was conducted in a 14-bed Respiratory ICU in a tertiary hospital in Beijing. Participative design was the method used for ICU nurses, hospital IT department and a software company to collaboratively research and develop the ICIS. Focus group discussions were conducted to understand the subjective perceptions of the nurses toward the ICIS. Nursing documentation time and quality were compared before and after system implementation. ICU nursing performance was extracted from the annual nursing performance data collected by the hospital. RESULTS: A participative design process was followed by the nurses in the ICU, the hospital IT staff and the software engineers in the company to develop and implement a highly useful ICIS. Nursing documentation was fully digitized and was significantly improved in quality and efficiency. The wrong data, missing data items and calculation errors were significantly reduced. Nurses spent more time on direct patient care after the introduction of the ICIS. The accuracy and efficiency of medication administration was also improved. The outcome was improvement in ward nursing performance as measured by ward management, routine nursing practices, disinfection and isolation, infection rate and mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses in this ICU unit in China actively participated in the ICIS development and fully used the system to document care. Introduction of the ICIS led to significant improvement in quality and efficiency in nursing documentation, medication order transcription and administration. It allowed nurses to spend more time with patients to improve quality of care. These led to improvement in overall nursing performance.

After a public outcry, the scheme was postponed and cancelled. Public views of care.data have previously been analysed"," this study aimed to understand contemporary general practitioners' (GPs) views of the scheme, which may have been influential in its downfall. DESIGN: Systematic search of media articles, followed by media content analysis. SETTING: UK-based mainstream and GP-facing media in 2013 and 2014. PARTICIPANTS: Articles were eligible if they focused on care.data, and GPs were quoted, authored the article, or if articles were written for a majority GP audience. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Themes which explained GPs' reactions to care.data and which could explain support for or opposition to the scheme. RESULTS: 162 media articles met inclusion criteria and were drawn from newspapers, news websites and GP-facing websites. GPs recognised care.data's potential value for research and improving care, but had grave concerns about the scheme's implementation. These centred the lack of safeguards and purpose around the scheme which meant patients were not able to make informed decisions about opt-out. GPs perceived they were poorly resourced to meet competing demands to both share patients' data and protect confidentiality. They distrusted the government's likely uses of the data and perceived a risk of patient reidentification if the data were sold onto commercial entities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings show specific concerns which GPs had about care.data which led to the withdrawal of support. Future NHS patient data-sharing schemes should engage with GPs and other clinicians as key stakeholders from the earliest moments of planning, so that their views and needs are incorporated into the design of such schemes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038006,Attitude of Health Personnel",England,*General Practice,*General Practitioners,Humans,Qualitative Research,"State Medicine,32912990,PMC7485233",

Several studies have shown that a wide range of nursing information is not interoperable and cannot be re-used in different health contexts. Difficulties arise when nurses share information with others involved in the delivery of nursing care. The aim of this study is to develop a nursing subset of patient problems that are prevalent in nursing practice, based on the SNOMED CT terminology to assist in the exchange and comparability of nursing information. METHODS: Explorative qualitative focus groups were used to collect data. Mixed focus groups were defined. Additionally, a nursing researcher and a nursing expert with knowledge of terminologies and a terminologist participated in each focus group. The participants, who work in a range of practical contexts, discussed and reviewed patient problems from various perspectives. RESULTS: Sixty-seven participants divided over seven focus groups selected and defined 119 patient problems. Each patient problem could be documented and coded with a current status or an at-risk status. Sixty-six percent of the patient problems included are covered by the definitions established by the International Classification of Nursing Practice, the reference terminology for nursing practice. For the remainder, definitions from either an official national guideline or a classification were used. Each of the 119 patient problems has a unique SNOMED CT identifier. CONCLUSIONS: To support the interoperability of nursing information, a national nursing subset of patient problems based on a terminology (SNOMED CT) has been developed. Using unambiguously defined patient problems is beneficial for clinical nursing practice, because nurses can then compare and exchange information from different settings. A key strength of this study is that nurses were extensively involved in the development process. Further research is required to link or associate nursing patient problems to concepts from a nursing classification with the same meaning."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-017-0567-5,Adult",Electronic Health Records/*standards,Female,Focus Groups,Health Information Interoperability/*standards,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,

Nevertheless, it is a challenging task due to the difficulty of learning the complex structure information of lung abnormality from chest X-ray images. In this paper, we propose a multi-view aggregation network with Transformer (TransMVAN) for pneumonia classification in chest X-ray images. Specifically, we propose to incorporate the knowledge from glance and focus views to enrich the feature representation of lung abnormality. Moreover, to capture the complex relationships among different lung regions, we propose a bi-directional multi-scale vision Transformer (biMSVT), with which the informative messages between different lung regions are propagated through two directions. In addition, we also propose a gated multi-view aggregation (GMVA) to adaptively select the feature information from glance and focus views for further performance enhancement of pneumonia diagnosis. Our proposed method achieves AUCs of 0.9645 and 0.9550 for pneumonia classification on two different chest X-ray image datasets. In addition, it achieves an AUC of 0.9761 for evaluating positive and negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, our proposed method also attains an AUC of 0.9741 for classifying non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia, and normal cases.

Some temporal relation shared tasks for the medical entity in English clinical notes have been organized in the past few years, such as the 2012 i2b2 NLP challenge, 2015 and 2016 clinical TempEval challenges. In these tasks, many heuristics rule-based and machine learning-based systems have been developed. In recent years, the deep neural network models have shown great potential on many problems including the relation classification. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a recurrent convolutional neural network (RNN-CNN) model for the temporal indexing task, which consists of four layers: input layer - generates representation for each context word of medical entities or temporal expressions", LSTM (long-short term memory) layer - learns the context information of each word in a sentence and outputs a new word representation sequence, CNN layer - extracts meaningful features from a sentence and outputs a new representation for medical entity or temporal expression," Output layer - takes the representations of medical entity, temporal expression and relation features as input and classifies the temporal relation. Finally, the time or time interval for each medical entity can be directly selected according to the probability of each temporal relation predicted by above model. RESULTS: To investigate the performance of our RNN-CNN model for the temporal indexing task, several baseline methods were also employed, such as the rule-based, support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) methods. Experiments conducted on a manually annotated corpus (including 563 clinical notes with 12,611 medical entities and 4006 temporal expressions) show that RNN-CNN model achieves the best F1-score of 75.97% for temporal relation classification and the best accuracy of 71.96% for temporal indexing. CONCLUSIONS: Neural network methods perform much better than the traditional rule-based and SVM-based method, which can capture more semantic information from the context of medical entities and temporal expressions. Besides, all our methods perform much better for the accurate time indexing than the time interval indexing, so how to improve the performance for time interval indexing will be the main focus in our future work."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-019-0735-x,""China",*Data Mining,*Electronic Health Records,Humans,*Medical Informatics Applications,

However, lack of digital skills together with access, confidence, trust and motivation issues present seemingly insurmountable barriers for many. Such digital health exclusion exacerbates existing health inequalities experienced by older people, people with less income, less education or who don't have English as a first language. This study examines the role of a city-wide digital inclusion programme in the North of England, which works with Voluntary Sector Community Organisations (VCSOs) to provide digital support to disadvantaged communities (Digital Health Hubs). The aim was to explore if and how Digital Health Hubs contribute to tackling health inequalities, with a specific focus on impacts on service-users and how these impacts are produced. METHODS: We used qualitative semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of service-users receiving digital support, and perspectives of staff working for organisations coordinating or providing digital support (n = 30). RESULTS: Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify four major themes and mapped to 'Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research' constructs. These were: programme components, recipient-centred support, impacts on service-users and system-level barriers to digital health services. Findings suggest moderators of implementation are provision of community spaces, social activities and devices and Wi-fi, and recipient-centred support through community understanding, personalised regular support and trusting relationships. Impacts on service-users include improved social and emotional resilience and basic digital skills. Health system-level barriers to digital health services, such as inconsistency in service provision, were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Themes highlight the importance of recipient-centred support by Voluntary and Community Sector Organisations (VCSOs) which centres the unique needs of specific communities. Our data provide policymakers with a model for implementation that could be replicated and scaled-up. Our data add to the public health, primary care and digital health research by proposing an initial programme theory for how Digital Health Hubs may reduce health inequalities, and recommendations for evaluation which consider short-, medium- and long-term outcomes, and contextual factors which are likely to be crucial to Digital Health Hubs' effectiveness."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12889-025-21418-y,Humans",England,*Qualitative Research,*Vulnerable Populations,Female,Male,Middle Aged,Adult,

NoSQL database systems have recently attracted much attention, but few studies in the literature address their direct comparison with relational databases when applied to build the persistence layer of a standardized medical information system. METHODS: One relational and two NoSQL databases (one document-based and one native XML database) of three different sizes have been created in order to evaluate and compare the response times (algorithmic complexity) of six different complexity growing queries, which have been performed on them. Similar appropriate results available in the literature have also been considered. RESULTS: Relational and non-relational NoSQL database systems show almost linear algorithmic complexity query execution. However, they show very different linear slopes, the former being much steeper than the two latter. Document-based NoSQL databases perform better in concurrency than in isolation, and also better than relational databases in concurrency. CONCLUSION: Non-relational NoSQL databases seem to be more appropriate than standard relational SQL databases when database size is extremely high (secondary use, research applications). Document-based NoSQL databases perform in general better than native XML NoSQL databases. EHR extracts visualization and edition are also document-based tasks more appropriate to NoSQL database systems.

Evidence of excess variation in neuroimaging practices when abuse is suspected may indicate opportunity for quality and safety improvement. OBJECTIVE: To quantify neuroimaging practice variation across children's hospitals among infants with fractures evaluated for abuse, with the hypothesis that hospitals would vary substantially in neuroimaging practices. As a secondary objective, factors associated with neuroimaging use were identified, with the hypothesis that age and factors associated with potential biases (ie, payer type and race or ethnicity) would be associated with neuroimaging use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included infants with a femur or humerus fracture or both undergoing abuse evaluation at 44 select US children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) from January 1, 2016, through March 30, 2020, including emergency department, observational, and inpatient encounters. Included infants were aged younger than 12 months with a femur or humerus fracture or both without overt signs or symptoms of head injury for whom a skeletal survey was performed. To focus on infants at increased risk for clinically occult head injuries, infants with billing codes suggestive of overt neurologic signs or symptoms were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate demographic, clinical, and temporal factors associated with use of neuroimaging.

There is evidence that trans-specialists, i.e. health professionals specializing in transgender care, are an important source of discrimination experienced by transgender individuals in healthcare. In this qualitative interview study, we explored the reasons for this possibly surprising finding by analyzing subjective views of trans-specialists on various issues related to discrimination of transgender individuals. METHODS: We conducted 20 semi-structured, qualitative, exploratory interviews with healthcare professionals specializing in transgender care. Interview questions were developed based on an extensive literature analysis and results of previous research on the topic. The interviews were conducted online, were digitally recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was conducted using the methods of content analysis and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The interviewees had great difficulty giving a consistent definition of the concept of gender identity. Most of them saw it as a self-determination of a transgender individual. Although herewith emphasizing the autonomy of transgender individuals, most trans-specialists felt that they had to be convinced of their patient's transsexuality to carry out treatment. Most trans-specialists reported having had doubts about whether some transgender individuals were suffering from gender incongruence or not. There was also ambiguity among interviewees about whether transsexuality is a mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify specific topics that can cause discrimination experiences on the part of transgender individuals in their contact with trans-specialists. These include the vagueness of the construct of gender identity and the ambivalence between respect for the autonomy of transgender individuals and the validation of the diagnosis """"transsexuality"""". Also, uncertainties regarding the classification of transsexuality as a mental illness can lead to experiences of discrimination. Furthermore, our results imply that trans-specialists might remember own discriminatory behavior less than it actually took place. Our results can contribute to the development of specific measures to avoid discrimination experiences of transgender individuals in contact with trans-specialists. These should include a reflection on one's own gender identity and training on mechanisms of discrimination."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12939-024-02313-1,Humans",*Transgender Persons/psychology,Male,Female,*Qualitative Research,*Health Personnel/psychology,Adult,*Interviews as Topic,

A nurse home visitation programme in the USA was found to improve a wide range of outcomes for young mothers and their children. However, a randomised controlled trial in England found no effect on short-term primary outcomes, although cognitive development up to age 2 showed improvement. Our study will use linked routinely collected health, education and social care data to evaluate the real-world effects of the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) on child outcomes up to age 7, with a focus on identifying whether the FNP works better for particular groups of families, thereby informing programme targeting and resource allocation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will construct a retrospective cohort of all women aged 13-24 years giving birth in English NHS hospitals between 2010 and 2017, linking information on mothers and children from FNP programme data, Hospital Episodes Statistics and the National Pupil Database. To assess the effectiveness of FNP, we will compare outcomes for eligible mothers ever and never enrolled in FNP, and their children, using two analysis strategies to adjust for measured confounding: propensity score matching and analyses adjusting for maternal characteristics up to enrolment/28 weeks gestation. Outcomes of interest include early childhood development, childhood unplanned hospital admissions for injury or maltreatment-related diagnoses and children in care. Subgroup analyses will determine whether the effect of FNP varied according to maternal characteristics (eg, age and education). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Nottingham Research Ethics Committee approved this study. Mothers participating in FNP were supportive of our planned research. Results will inform policy-makers for targeting home visiting programmes. Methodological findings on the accuracy and reliability of cross-sectoral data linkage will be of interest to researchers."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038530,""Adolescent",Adult,Child,"Child, Preschool",England,Female,Humans,Infant,

The processes for gathering and using this data constitute a niche where current research is developed. In this context, the existing protocols for obtaining informed consent from participants are outdated, as they are based not only on the assumption that personal data are anonymized, but that they will continue to be so in the future. As a result, it is essential that research ethics committees take on new capabilities and revisit values such as privacy and freedom, updating protocols, methodologies and working procedures. This change in the work culture will provide legal security to the personnel involved in research, will make it possible to guarantee the protection of the privacy of the subjects of the data, and will permit orienting the exploitation of data to avoid the commodification of personal data in this era of deidentification, so that research meets actual social needs and not spurious or opportunistic interests disguised as research."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.gaceta.2018.02.007,""*Big Data",Computer Security,Confidentiality,Decision Making,Delivery of Health Care,"Ethics Committees, Research","*Ethics, Research",Guidelines as Topic,

With that in mind, we have recently argued for Design Bioethics-the use of purpose-built, engineered research tools that allow researchers to investigate moral decision-making in ways that are embodied and contextualized. In this paper, we outline the development, testing and implementation of a novel prototype tool in the Design Bioethics Workshop-with each step illustrated with collected data. Titled 'Tracing Tomorrow' (www.tracingtomorrow.org), the tool is a narrative game to investigate young people's values and preferences in the context of digital phenotyping for mental health. The process involved (1) Working with young people to discover, validate and define the morally relevant cases or problems, (2) Building and testing the game concept in collaboration with relevant groups and game developers, (3) Developing prototypes that were tested and iterated in partnership with groups of young people and game developers and (4) Disseminating the game to young people to collect data to investigate research questions. We argue that Design Bioethics yields tools that are relevant, representative and meaningful to target populations and provide improved data for bioethics analysis.

OBJECTIVE: This study is the first in a series which aims to estimate the current rates of AI technology use as well as perceived benefits, harms, and risks experienced by community members (CMs) and mental health professionals (MHPs). METHODS: This study involved 2 web-based surveys conducted in Australia. The surveys collected data on demographics, technology comfort, attitudes toward AI, specific AI use cases, and experiences of benefits and harms from AI use. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and thematic analysis of open-ended responses were conducted. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 107 CMs and 86 MHPs. General attitudes toward AI varied, with CMs reporting neutral and MHPs reporting more positive attitudes. Regarding AI usage, 28% (30/108) of CMs used AI, primarily for quick support (18/30, 60%) and as a personal therapist (14/30, 47%). Among MHPs, 43% (37/86) used AI"," mostly for research (24/37, 65%) and report writing (20/37, 54%). While the majority found AI to be generally beneficial (23/30, 77% of CMs and 34/37, 92% of MHPs), specific harms and concerns were experienced by 47% (14/30) of CMs and 51% (19/37) of MHPs. There was an equal mix of positive and negative sentiment toward the future of AI in mental health care in open feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial AI tools are increasingly being used by CMs and MHPs. Respondents believe AI will offer future advantages for mental health care in terms of accessibility, cost reduction, personalization, and work efficiency. However, they were equally concerned about reducing human connection, ethics, privacy and regulation, medical errors, potential for misuse, and data security. Despite the immense potential, integration into mental health systems must be approached with caution, addressing legal and ethical concerns while developing safeguards to mitigate potential harms.

However, the lack of a precise and standard guide for the tortuosity evaluation hinders its use for diagnostic and treatment purposes. This work aims to advance in the standardization of the retinal vascular tortuosity as a clinical biomarker with diagnostic potential, allowing, thereby, the validation of objective computational measurements on the basis of the entire spectrum of the expert knowledge. METHODS: This paper describes a multi-expert validation process of the computational vascular tortuosity measurements of reference. A group of five experts, covering the different clinical profiles of an ophthalmological service, and a four-grade scale from non-tortuous to severe tortuosity as well as non-tortuous / tortuous and asymptomatic / symptomatic binary classifications are considered for the analysis of the the multi-expert validation procedure. The specialists rating process comprises two rounds involving all the experts and a joint round to establish consensual rates. The expert agreement is analyzed throughout the rating procedure and, then, the consensual rates are set as the reference to validate the prognostic performance of four computational tortuosity metrics of reference. RESULTS: The Kappa indexes for the intra-rater agreement analysis were obtained between 0.35 and 0.83 whereas for the inter-rater agreement in the asymptomatic / symptomatic classification were between 0.22 and 0.76. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each expert against the consensual rates were placed between 0.61 and 0.83 whereas the prognostic performance of the best objective tortuosity metric was 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high inter and intra-rater variability, especially for the case of the four grade scale. The prognostic performance of the tortuosity measurements is close to the experts' performance, especially for Grisan measurement. However, there is a gap between the automatic effectiveness and the expert perception given the lack of clinical criteria in the computational measurements."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-018-0598-3,""Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods",Humans,Observer Variation,Ophthalmologists/standards/*statistics & numerical data,Ophthalmology/methods/standards/statistics & numerical data,"Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards",Reproducibility of Results,Retinal Diseases/*diagnosis,

This gap highlights the opportunity for tailored educational resources to enhance health care professionals' interactions with TNBI individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore health care professionals' perspectives on education and awareness of health issues related to TNBI individuals. Specifically, it aimed to identify their needs, challenges, and preferences in accessing and using digital educational resources to enhance their knowledge and competence in providing inclusive and effective care for this population. METHODS: A qualitative research approach was used in this study. In total, 15 health care professionals were recruited via convenience sampling to participate in semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was applied to identify recurring codes and themes. RESULTS: The study identified several themes and subthemes related to gender diversity awareness, inclusive communication and understanding the needs of TNBI individuals, societal and structural challenges, regulatory gaps in training and support infrastructure, education and training needs for health care professionals on TNBI care, educational resources and training tools for TNBI care, challenges and design considerations for eHealth tools integrations, and evaluating eHealth impact. Participants identified communication barriers, the need for health care providers to use inclusive language, and gaps in both health care system infrastructure and specialized training for gender-affirming care. In addition, participants expressed a need for comprehensive education on transgender and nonbinary health issues, resources for mental health professionals, user-friendly design, and accessibility features in eHealth tools. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed substantial deficiencies in health care professionals' knowledge of gender diversity, cultural competency, and the importance of inclusive communication. Addressing the identified barriers and challenges through targeted interventions, such as providing training and support for health care professionals, investing in user-friendly design and data security, and promoting cultural competence in TNBI health care, is essential.

The aim was to explore the similarities and differences in education and training in military medicine for health professionals in the Nordic countries, and more specifically to identify the specific challenges regarding education and training of military medicine, and how e-learning is used at present and the opportunities for the future. METHODS: Key educators within military medicine in the Nordic countries, as approved by the respective Surgeons General, were interviewed and the interviews were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The data showed that all Nordic countries cooperate in the field of military medical training to some extent. The models of recruitment and employment of health professionals differed as well as the degree of political support. These differences affected the ability for health professionals to gain actual experience from the military environment. To improve the quality of medical education and training, attempts were made to recruit physicians. The recruitment of physicians was considered a challenge which had resulted in disruptions of courses, training programs and maintenance of accreditation. The Nordic countries were described as having commonalities in the military medical systems and common needs for international collaboration within training, but differing in the range of education and training. Gaps were identified in methods for transferring outcomes from education into practice, as well as regarding evaluation and feedback of outcomes to military medicine. The educational tradition was described as oriented towards practical skills training without requirements on pedagogical education of educators. The results confirmed previous studies showing that e-learning was underutilized. Contextual understanding and experience of healthcare were seen as crucial factors for successful e-learning development.

Referral to digital interventions could lead to a larger proportion of patients accessing structured interventions for healthy lifestyle promotion, but such referral might have unknown implications for clinicians with patients accessing such interventions. This qualitative study aimed to explore the perceptions of clinicians in primary care on healthy lifestyle promotion with or without digital screening and intervention. METHODS: Focus group interviews were conducted at 10 primary care clinics in Sweden with clinicians from different health professions. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using content analysis, with inspiration from a phenomenological-hermeneutic method involving naïve understanding, structural analysis and comprehensive understanding. RESULTS: Two major themes captured clinicians' perceptions on healthy lifestyle promotion: 1) the need for structured professional practice and 2) deficient professional practice as a hinder for implementation. Sub-themes in theme 1 were striving towards professionalism, which for participants meant working in a standardized fashion, with replicable routines regardless of clinic, as well as being able to monitor statistics on individual patient and group levels"," and embracing the future with critical optimism, meaning expecting to develop professionally but also being concerned about the consequences of integrating digital tools into primary care, particularly regarding the importance of personal interaction between patient and provider.

CONCLUSIONS: In efforts to increase evidence-based practice and lighten the burden of clinicians in primary care, decision- and policy-makers planning the introduction of digital tools for healthy lifestyle promotion will need to explicitly define their role as complements to face-to-face encounters. Our overriding hope is that this study will contribute to maintaining meaningfulness in the patient-clinician encounter, when digital tools are added to facilitate patient behavior change of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12875-018-0829-z,""Adult",*Attitude of Health Personnel,Behavior Therapy/*methods,Female,Focus Groups,Health Promotion/*methods,

These images have been made publicly accessible via The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). There have been numerous requests for additional explanatory metadata on the following datasets - RIDER, Interobserver, Lung1, and Head-Neck1. To support repeatability, reproducibility, generalizability, and transparency in radiomics research, we publish the subjects' clinical data, extracted radiomics features, and digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) headers of these four datasets with descriptive metadata, in order to be more compliant with findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data management principles. ACQUISITION AND VALIDATION METHODS: Overall survival time intervals were updated using a national citizens registry after internal ethics board approval. Spatial offsets of the primary gross tumor volume (GTV) regions of interest (ROIs) associated with the Lung1 CT series were improved on the TCIA. GTV radiomics features were extracted using the open-source Ontology-Guided Radiomics Analysis Workflow (O-RAW). We reshaped the output of O-RAW to map features and extraction settings to the latest version of Radiomics Ontology, so as to be consistent with the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI). Digital imaging and communications in medicine metadata was extracted using a research version of Semantic DICOM (SOHARD, GmbH, Fuerth"," Germany). Subjects' clinical data were described with metadata using the Radiation Oncology Ontology. All of the above were published in Resource Descriptor Format (RDF), that is, triples. Example SPARQL queries are shared with the reader to use on the online triples archive, which are intended to illustrate how to exploit this data submission. DATA FORMAT: The accumulated RDF data are publicly accessible through a SPARQL endpoint where the triples are archived. The endpoint is remotely queried through a graph database web application at http://sparql.cancerdata.org. SPARQL queries are intrinsically federated, such that we can efficiently cross-reference clinical, DICOM, and radiomics data within a single query, while being agnostic to the original data format and coding system. The federated queries work in the same way even if the RDF data were partitioned across multiple servers and dispersed physical locations. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS: The public availability of these data resources is intended to support radiomics features replication, repeatability, and reproducibility studies by the academic community. The example SPARQL queries may be freely used and modified by readers depending on their research question. Data interoperability and reusability are supported by referencing existing public ontologies. The RDF data are readily findable and accessible through the aforementioned link.

One approach to support veterinarians may be to enable pet owners to, for instance, make informed decisions on how urgent their animal needs to be examined by a veterinary professional through an mHealth application. For this, stakeholder requirements need to be gathered, which should provide as a starting point for the development of such a decision support system. RESULTS: 955 publications were screened, resulting in the extraction of 10 requirements to mHealth applications for animal owners from 13 publications. Most frequently mentioned aspects were: ensuring complete information input by the user (6 mentions) and displaying a disclaimer about application limitations prominently (5 mentions). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the extracted requirements focus on the design of the human-computer interface, revealing this as a crucial point to such applications, especially in guiding animal owners through information and ensuring understanding, particularly of application limitations.

The higher TB risk and burden in men has implications for the whole population and reaching them earlier with TB services will reduce onward transmission in households, communities, and workplaces. The absence of a comprehensive guidance and the lack of substantial empirical evidence on TB care approaches that are responsive to the needs of men in Nigeria exacerbates this problem. Therefore, this research aimed to co-create a gender-responsive intervention for men in peri-urban communities in Nigeria. METHODS: Our study utilised a researcher-led collaborative approach to engage local TB stakeholders including communities adversely affected by the disease to co-create a gender-responsive TB intervention. Between March and November 2022, we engaged 13 local TB stakeholders in a three-phase participatory intervention design process. This engagement involved two iterative cycles of Delphi research online, and an in-person workshop. In the first and second phases, participants described the potential impact of 15 listed interventions and prioritised combinations of nine interventions deemed to be effective in overcoming identified gendered barriers. Responses were analysed using a combination of qualitative framework approach, content analysis, and summary descriptive statistics assisted by NVivo software. Stakeholder consensus on a preferred intervention package was reached during the participatory workshop. RESULTS: Overall, participants prioritised approaches that sought to actively find and systematically screen men for TB including awareness creation as a crucial component. The stakeholders placed significant considerations on the synergy between interventions and their programmatic sustainability when making their final choices. Consequently, a complex intervention package comprising three components was developed. These included targeted awareness creation among men in communities", TB screening in male-dominated socio-cultural congregate settings," and the use of digital chest X-ray screening. Anticipated early outputs of this intervention included improved TB knowledge, increased care-seeking, reduced TB-related costs and TB stigma, and accelerated early diagnosis among men in Nigeria. CONCLUSION: Leveraging the insights and experiences of local stakeholders through iterative engagements yielded consensus on a viable gender-responsive TB intervention."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-025-12241-7,Humans",Nigeria,Male,Female,*Tuberculosis/prevention & control/therapy,Cooperative Behavior,

In December 2016, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ERIC. We included all English-language studies on digital storytelling that reported at least one outcome from Levels 2 (learning) or 3 (behaviour) of The New World Kirkpatrick Model. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted data. RESULTS: The comprehensive search (i.e., digital storytelling in healthcare and HPE) resulted in 1486 unique titles/abstracts. Of these, 153 were eligible for full review and 42 pertained to HPE. Sixteen HPE articles were suitable for data extraction"," 14 focused on health professionals' learning and two investigated health professionals' learning as well as their behaviour changes. Half represented the undergraduate nursing context. The purposes for using digital storytelling were eclectic. The co-creation of patients' digital stories with health professionals as well as the creation and use of health professionals' own digital stories enhanced learning. Patients' digital stories alone had minimal impact on health professionals' learning.

METHODS:  Assessment of literature and scientific conference proceedings, current and pending policy development, and review of commercial applications nationally and internationally. RESULTS:  CDS research is approaching multiple landmark points driven by commercialization interests, emerging regulatory policy, and increased public awareness. However, the availability of patient-related """"Big Data"""" sources from genomics and mobile health, expanded privacy considerations, applications of service-based computational techniques and tools, the emergence of """"app"""" ecosystems, and evolving patient-centric approaches reflect the distributed, complex, and uneven maturity of the CDS landscape. Nonetheless, the field of CDS is yet to mature. The lack of standards and CDS-specific policies from regulatory bodies that address the privacy and safety concerns of data and knowledge sharing to support CDS development may continue to slow down the broad CDS adoption within and across institutions. CONCLUSION:  Partnerships with Electronic Health Record and commercial CDS vendors, policy makers, standards development agencies, clinicians, and patients are needed to see CDS deployed in the evolving learning health system."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1055/s-0038-1641215,""Decision Making, Computer-Assisted","*Decision Support Systems, Clinical/legislation & jurisprudence",Electronic Health Records,Government Regulation,"*Information Dissemination/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence"",30157504,PMC6115214",,,,

However, the experimental annotation of locations is not even complete for well-studied model organisms. Text mining might aid database curators to add experimental annotations from the scientific literature. Existing extraction methods have difficulties to distinguish relationships between proteins and cellular locations co-mentioned in the same sentence. RESULTS: LocText was created as a new method to extract protein locations from abstracts and full texts. LocText learned patterns from syntax parse trees and was trained and evaluated on a newly improved LocTextCorpus. Combined with an automatic named-entity recognizer, LocText achieved high precision (P = 86%±4). After completing development, we mined the latest research publications for three organisms: human (Homo sapiens), budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana). Examining 60 novel, text-mined annotations, we found that 65% (human), 85% (yeast), and 80% (cress) were correct. Of all validated annotations, 40% were completely novel, i.e. did neither appear in the annotations nor the text descriptions of Swiss-Prot. CONCLUSIONS: LocText provides a cost-effective, semi-automated workflow to assist database curators in identifying novel protein localization annotations. The annotations suggested through text-mining would be verified by experts to guarantee high-quality standards of manually-curated databases such as Swiss-Prot."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2021-9,""*Data Mining","*Databases, Protein",Gene Ontology,Humans,Molecular Sequence Annotation,Proteins/*metabolism,"*Software"",29343218,PMC5773052",,

However, healthcare professionals' financial constraints and tight schedules sending them away from the workplace for CPD training is a challenge. eLearning is becoming the best solution to overcome those barriers and create accessible, efficient, flexible, and convenient professional development. However, evidence is limited on health professionals' intention to use eLearning-based CPD and its predictors. Hence this study aimed to assess healthcare professionals' intention to use eLearning-based CPD and its predictors in Amhara region referral hospitals, in Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 28 to April 28, 2023. A total of 976 healthcare professionals participated in this study. Proportional allocation and simple random sampling were used to select participants for the study. UTAUT2 model was applied to develop a theoretical framework. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used and a 5% pretest was performed. Data were entered into Epi data 4.6 and exported to SPSS 26 for descriptive analysis. AMOS 23 SEM was also used to describe and assess the degree and significance of relationships between variables. RESULTS: About 51.8% (506/976) (95% CI: 48.7-55.0) of participants have the intention to use eLearning for CPD. Performance expectancy (ß = 0.233, p-value < 0.01), effort expectancy (ß = 0.082, p-value < 0.05), facilitating condition (ß = 0.102, p-value < 0.05), hedonic motivation (ß = 0.199, P-value < 0.001), habit (ß = 0.473, P-value < 0.001), and computer literacy (ß = 0.116, p-value < 0.001) had a positive relationship with intention to use eLearning based CPD. Age and gender were also a moderator of the habit of using eLearning based on CPD. CONCLUSION: and recommendation. Overall, healthcare professionals' intention to use eLearning-based CPD was found low. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, habit, and computer literacy had a significantly positive influence on the intention to use eLearning-based CPD.

The conditions of and the solutions for the justified use of the occasionally unexplainable technology in healthcare are an active field of research. In March 2024, the European Union agreed upon the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), requiring medical AI-DSS to be ad-hoc explainable or to use post-hoc explainability methods. The ethical debate does not seem to settle on this requirement yet. This systematic review aims to outline and categorize the positions and arguments in the ethical debate. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on PubMed, BASE, and Scopus for English-speaking scientific peer-reviewed publications from 2016 to 2024. The inclusion criterion was to give explicit requirements of explainability for AI-DSS in healthcare and reason for it. Non-domain-specific documents, as well as surveys, reviews, and meta-analyses were excluded. The ethical requirements for explainability outlined in the documents were qualitatively analyzed with respect to arguments for the requirement of explainability and the required level of explainability. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 1662 documents"," 44 documents were included in the review after eligibility screening of the remaining full texts. Our analysis showed that 17 records argue in favor of the requirement of explainable AI methods (xAI) or ad-hoc explainable models, providing 9 categories of arguments. The other 27 records argued against a general requirement, providing 11 categories of arguments. Also, we found that 14 works advocate the need for context-dependent levels of explainability, as opposed to 30 documents, arguing for context-independent, absolute standards. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review of reasons shows no clear agreement on the requirement of post-hoc explainability methods or ad-hoc explainable models for AI-DSS in healthcare. The arguments found in the debate were referenced and responded to from different perspectives, demonstrating an interactive discourse. Policymakers and researchers should watch the development of the debate closely.

Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a well-established open-source solution with the major benefit that data representations can be tailored to support specific use cases. These data representations can be defined and improved via an iterative approach together with domain experts and the medical researchers using the platform. To facilitate these discussions, it is important to understand how users interact with the system. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop metrics for describing user interactions with clinical data warehouses in general and i2b2 in particular. Moreover, we aimed to develop a dashboard featuring interactive visualizations that inform data engineers and data stewards about potential improvements. METHODS: We first identified metrics for different data usage dimensions and extracted the relevant metadata about previous user queries from the i2b2 database schema for further analysis. We then implemented associated visualizations in Python and integrated the results into an interactive dashboard using Dash. RESULTS: The identified categories of metrics include frequency of use, session duration, and use of functionality and features. We created a dashboard that extends our local i2b2 data warehouse platform, focusing on the latter category, further broken down into the number of queries, frequently queried concepts, and query complexity. The implementation is available as open-source software. CONCLUSION: A range of metrics can be derived from metadata logged in the i2b2 database schema to provide data engineers and data stewards with a comprehensive understanding of how users interact with the platform.

The summary care record (SCR"," the Kjernejournal in Norwegian) is the first national system for sharing patient information among the various levels and institutions of health care throughout the country. The health authorities have invested heavily in the development, implementation and deployment of this tool, and as of 2017 all Norwegian citizens have a personalised SCR. However, as there remains limited knowledge about health professionals' use of, experiences with and opinions regarding this new tool, the purpose of this study was to explore doctors' direct SCR experiences. METHODS: We conducted 25 in-depth interviews with 10 doctors from an emergency ward, 5 doctors from an emergency clinic and 10 doctors from 5 general practitioner offices. We then transcribed, thematically coded and analysed the interviews utilising a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: The SCRs contain several features for providing core patient information that is particularly relevant in acute or emergency situations"," nonetheless, we found that the doctors generally used only one of the tool's six functions, namely, the pharmaceutical summary. In addition, they primarily used this summary for a few subgroups of patients, including in the emergency ward for unconscious patients, for elderly patients with multiple prescriptions and for patients with substance abuse conditions. The primary difference of the pharmaceutical summary compared with the other functions of the tool is that patient information is automatically updated from a national pharmaceutical server, while other clinically relevant functions, like the critical information category, require manual updates by the health professionals themselves, thereby potentially causing variations in the accuracy, completeness and trustworthiness of the data. CONCLUSION: Therefore, we can assume that the popularity of the pharmaceutical summary among doctors is based on their preference to place their trust in - and therefore more often utilise - automatically updated information. In addition, the doctors' lack of trust in manually updated information might have severe implications for the future success of the SCR and for similar digital tools for sharing patient information."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-3069-y,""Attitude of Health Personnel","Emergency Service, Hospital",Female,General Practitioners/*psychology,Humans,*Information Dissemination,

Informatics ethics are affected by students' socio-demographic characteristics. This study was conducted to examine nursing students' online information searching strategies and attitudes towards informatics ethical values. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study design was employed. A non-probability sampling method was used to determine the research sample. Data for the study were collected from students aged = 18 years who were studying at the faculty of nursing of a university located in the west of the country between 15 September 2021 and 15 June 2022 and who agreed to participate in the research voluntarily. Data were collected using a 'Descriptive Information Form', the 'Online Information Searching Strategy Inventory' and the 'Attitude Scale towards Informatics Ethical Values'. RESULTS: Data were collected from a total of 710 first-, second-, third- and fourth-year nursing students. Of the nursing students participating in the study, 40.1% were between the ages of 20 and 21, and 61.5% were female. A statistically significant difference was determined between their mean scores on the total information searching strategy scale and gender, class, the status of having a personal computer, level of computer use, the status of having an internet connection and the frequency of searching for information on the Internet (p < 0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant difference between their mean scores on the total attitude scale towards informatics ethical values scale and age, gender, school year, the status of having a personal computer, the status of having an internet connection, frequency of searching for information on the Internet and the duration of searching for information online a week (p < 0.05). A positive, low-level, statistically significant relationship was found between nursing students' attitudes towards informatics ethical values and online information searching strategies (r = 0.339, p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it was found that when online information searching strategies increased, attitudes towards informatics ethical values increased as well. It is thought that our study results will be a guide for nursing students to develop online information search strategies throughout their educational lives and raise awareness about informatics ethics.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed using a predefined set of queries, which identified 368 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 15 were selected for consideration of best paper candidates, which were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. The top five papers according to the external reviewers' ranking were discussed in a consensus meeting. Finally, the paper that received the highest score from four of the five experts was selected as the best paper on social media and ethics for patients and consumers of the year 2019. RESULTS: Despite using the terms """"ethics"""" and """"ethical"""" in the search query, we retrieved very few articles. The bibliometric analysis identified three major clusters centred on """"social"""", """"health"""", and """"study"""". Among the top five papers, one was a review where the authors identified ethical issues across four areas at the intersection of social media and health: 1) the impact of social networking sites on the doctor-patient relationship", 2) the development of e-health platforms to deliver care, 3) the use of online data and algorithms to inform health research," and 4) the broader public health consequences of widespread social media use. The other papers highlighted ethical concerns in using social media to interact with patients at different phases of a clinical research protocol, such as recruitment phase, participant engagement, data linkage, and detection and monitoring of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that most users do not think that using social media for patient monitoring in clinical research, for example using Twitter for clinical trial recruitment, constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, further research is needed to identify whether and how views on ethical concerns differed between social media platforms and across populations."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1055/s-0040-1702022,Consumer Health Informatics/*ethics",Female,Humans,Information Dissemination/ethics,Male,

However, little is known about how patients prefer to be informed about the possible usage of their routine data and/or biosamples for research purposes before reaching a consent decision. Specifically, we investigated the setting, the timing and the responsible staff for the information and consent process. METHODS: We performed a quasi-randomized controlled trial and compared the method by which patients were informed either in the patient admission area following patient admission by the same staff member (Group A) or in a separate room by another staff member (Group B). The consent decision was hypothetical in nature. Additionally, we evaluated if there was the need for additional time after the information session and before taking the consent decision. Data were collected during a structured interview based on questionnaires where participants reflected on the information and consent process they went through. RESULTS: Questionnaire data were obtained from 157 participants in Group A and 106 participants in Group B. Overall, participants in both groups were satisfied with their experienced process and with the way information was provided. They reported that their (hypothetical) consent decision was freely made. Approximately half of the interested participants in Group B did not show up in the separate room, while all interested participants in Group A could be informed about the secondary use of their routine data and left-over samples. No participants, except for one in Group B, wanted to take extra time for their consent decision. The hypothetical consent rate for both routine data and left-over samples was very high in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The willingness to support medical research by allowing the use of routine data and left-over samples seems to be widespread among patients. Information concerning this secondary data use may be given by trained administrative staff immediately following patient admission. Patients mainly prefer making a consent decision directly after information is provided and discussed.

Current ethical discussions on developing health data platforms (e.g. the German Medical Informatics Initiative, MII) have primarily addressed patient-related benefits and risks of reusing this data. Less is known about the perspectives of healthcare providers, such as hospitals, that make health data available through these platforms. However, the risks they perceive and a resulting reluctance to share data, along with the lack of strategies for managing these risks, could significantly impede research with health data. In this exploratory qualitative study, we investigated the interests and risks relevant to healthcare providers in the secondary use of health data, and strategies to address these risks (pre-registration: https://osf.io/uxds ). METHODS: We conducted online expert interviews (N = 21) between May and August 2023 with German representatives of different stakeholder groups (e.g. healthcare providers, researchers, patient representatives, data protection officers) with expertise in the secondary use of health data and the associated interests and risks for providers. We analysed the data using the deductive-inductive approach to qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Interviewees attributed several potentials reusing health data, such as improving healthcare quality and transparency. They also pointed to risks, including their causes and consequences for providers' reputation, economic and existential situation. Risks included a) biased results and interpretation of data analyses due to inadequate data validity and inappropriate analytical approaches, b) questionable reuse purposes, c) liability risks due to a lack of control over shared data and unresolved legal questions, and d) improved transparency that may reveal challenges and misconduct in healthcare. Suggested strategies for risk mitigation related to use and access decisions on secondary use requests. These include a) developing risk-reducing policies, b) ensuring transparent decision-making processes by involving all relevant stakeholders and applying structured risk-benefit assessments, and c) measures to improve the validity of secondary analyses. In addition, the interviewees identified further need for action to be addressed by providers, researchers and policymakers. CONCLUSION: These findings point to needs and opportunities for action to manage risks that providers associate with health data reuse. Decision-making processes on secondary use requests should be based on normative principles, and quality, safety and trust in health data reuse should be enhanced. These recommendations should be taken up by responsible stakeholders in initiatives such as the MII, among researchers and policymakers to reduce reluctance and promote research with health data."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-025-12500-7,Humans",*Qualitative Research,*Health Personnel/psychology,*Interviews as Topic,Risk Assessment,Germany,Stakeholder Participation,Attitude of Health Personnel,

The scale, pace and novelty of these applications raise a number of urgent sociotechnical, ethical and legal questions, including optimal methods of data storage, management and access. Although the open science movement advocates unfettered access to research data, many of the UK's longitudinal cohort studies operate systems of managed data access, in which access is governed by legal and ethical agreements between stewards of research datasets and researchers wishing to make use of them. Amongst other things, these agreements aim to respect the reasonable expectations of the research participants who provided data and samples, as expressed in the consent process. Arguably, responsible data management and governance of data and sample use are foundational to the consent process in longitudinal studies and are an important source of trustworthiness in the eyes of those who contribute data to genomic and biosocial research. METHODS: This paper presents an ethnographic case study exploring the foundational principles of a governance infrastructure for Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data ACcess (METADAC), which are operationalised through a committee known as the METADAC Access Committee. METADAC governs access to phenotype, genotype and 'omic' data and samples from five UK longitudinal studies. FINDINGS: Using the example of METADAC, we argue that three key structural features are foundational for practising responsible data sharing: independence and transparency", interdisciplinarity," and participant-centric decision-making. We observe that the international research community is proactively working towards optimising the use of research data, integrating/linking these data with routine data generated by health and social care services and other administrative data services to improve the analysis, interpretation and utility of these data. The governance of these new complex data assemblages will require a range of expertise from across a number of domains and disciplines, including that of study participants. Human-mediated decision-making bodies will be central to ensuring achievable, reasoned and responsible decisions about the use of these data"," the METADAC model described in this paper provides an example of how this could be realised."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6,""*Big Data",Biomedical Research/economics/*ethics,"Databases, Genetic/economics/ethics",Genomics/*ethics,Genotype,

However, senior people may find it difficult using mobile/smartphones, especially the digital calendar and short text message features. Therefore, senior people might need user-friendly, flexible, and interactive digital calendars that provide them with active reminders about their everyday activities. This study focuses on community dwelling seniors' experiences learning and using RemindMe, an interactive digital calendar with active reminders, as part of customizing an intervention appropriate for senior people with cognitive impairments. METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with 20 community dwelling seniors (11 men and 9 women) who all had used RemindMe for six weeks. The focus groups were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: For participants in this study, using a calendar was an essential part of their everyday lives, but only a few had experiences using a digital calendar. Although the participants described RemindMe as easy to use, they had a difficult time incorporating RemindMe into their daily routines. In part, these difficulties were the result of the participants needing to change their mobile/smartphone routines. Some participants felt that using an interactive digital calendar was a sign of modernity allowing them to take part in the society at large, but others felt that their inability to use the technology was due to their age, dependence, and loss of function. Participants found that receiving active reminders through short text messages followed by actively acknowledging the reminder helped them perform more everyday life activities. This feature gave them a higher sense of independence and control. CONCLUSIONS: Community dwelling seniors found that RemindMe was easy to learn and to use, although they also found it challenging to integrate into their everyday lives. For senior people to make the effort to develop new routines for mobile/smartphone use, a prerequisite for using a digital calendar, they need to be motivated and believe that the technology will make their lives better."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12877-019-1128-9,""Aged","Aged, 80 and over",*Calendars as Topic,*Cell Phone,Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology/psychology/therapy,Female,Focus Groups/*methods,Humans,

Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) has emerged as a cost-effective solution in healthcare settings. However, its impact on interpreters, particularly the specific enabling and hindering factors from their point of view remains underexplored. For example, in some studies, VRI interpreters report higher stress and job dissatisfaction. We hypothesize that interpreters' work experience and supervision attendance mitigate negative effects. We tested this hypothesis using a quantitative approach. Additionally, we analyzed qualitative data to uncover more enabling and hindering factors. METHODS: A sample of 87 interpreters working in Austria and Germany was included in this multi-methods study. Stress, job dissatisfaction, work experience, and supervision were analyzed using correlations and group comparisons. Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic content analysis to identify enabling and hindering factors, with network analysis exploring their interconnections. RESULTS: Longer work experience correlated with lower stress. Supervision had no significant effect on stress or job satisfaction. Thematic content analysis identified 21 factors affecting VRI: While VRI enhances efficiency and emotional distance, interpreters face technical problems and difficulties arising from the lack of physical presence. Network analysis confirmed that VRI settings are characterized by a close interplay between these enabling and hindering factors. DISCUSSION: Strategies for using VRI can be derived from these data. VRI is an efficient alternative to in-person interpreting, with challenges that can be mitigated. Training healthcare personnel in handling VRI and optimizing VRI conditions can contribute to better healthcare outcomes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1477965,Humans",Austria,Germany,Female,Male,Adult,*Translating,*Job Satisfaction,

However, immigrant populations are seldom included in various stages of the development and implementation of assistive technology, which does not optimize technology acceptance. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to gain an in-depth understanding of the acceptance of a digital personal assistant, called Anne4Care, by older adult immigrants living with dementia in their own homes. METHODS: This study used a qualitative descriptive research design with naturalistic inquiry. A total of 13 older adults participated in this study. The participants were invited for 2 interviews. After an introduction of Anne4Care, the first interview examined the lives and needs of participants, their expectations, and previous experiences with assistive technology in daily life. Four months later, the second interview sought to understand facilitators and barriers, suggestions for modifications, and the role of health care professionals. Three semistructured interviews were conducted with health care professionals to examine the roles and challenges they experienced in the use and implementation of Anne4Care. Content analysis, using NVivo11, was performed on all transcripts. RESULTS: All 13 participants had an immigration background. There were 10 male and 3 female participants, with ages ranging from 52 to 83 years. Participants were diagnosed with an early-stage form of dementia or acquired brain injury. None of the older adult participants knew or used digital assistive technology at the beginning. They obtained assistance from health care professionals and family caregivers who explained and set up the technology. Four themes were found to be critical aspects of the acceptance of the digital personal assistant Anne4Care: (1) use of Anne4Care, (2) positive aspects of Anne4Care, (3) challenges with Anne4Care, and (4) expectations. Assistance at first increased the burden on health care professionals and families. After the initial effort, most health care professionals and families experienced that Anne4Care reduced their tasks and stress. Contributions of Anne4Care included companionship, help with daily tasks, and opportunities to communicate in multiple languages. On the other hand, some participants expressed anxiety toward the use of Anne4Care. Furthermore, the platform required an internet connection at home and Anne4Care could not be used outside the home. CONCLUSIONS: Although older adult immigrants living with dementia had no previous experience with digital assistive technology specifically, the acceptance of the digital personal assistant, called Anne4Care, by older adult immigrants living with dementia was rather high. The digital assistant can be further developed to allow for interactive conversations and for use outside of one's home.

The user-friendliness of an eIC application and its acceptance by stakeholders plays a central role in achieving successful implementation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify insights for the design and implementation of a user-friendly, personalized, and long-term eIC application based on a usability study with (potential) research participants and semistructured interviews with stakeholders on the practical integration of such an application into their daily practice. METHODS: An eIC prototype was evaluated and refined through usability testing among Belgian citizens and iterative redesign. On the basis of a digital literacy questionnaire, a heterogeneous sample of participants was established. Participants needed to complete a series of usability tasks related to personalization and long-term interaction with the research team while using the """"think aloud"""" technique. In addition, usability tests involved completing the System Usability Scale questionnaire and taking part in a semistructured feedback interview. Furthermore, semistructured interviews were conducted with ethics committee members, health care professionals, and pharmaceutical industry representatives active in Belgium and involved in clinical research. Thematic analysis was undertaken using the NVivo software (Lumivero). RESULTS: In total, 3 iterations of usability tests were conducted with 10 participants each. Each cycle involved some participants who reported having low digital skills. The System Usability Scale scores related to the tasks on personalization and long-term interaction increased after each iteration and reached 69.5 (SD 8.35) and 71.3 (SD 16.1) out of 100, respectively, which represents above-average usability. Semistructured interviews conducted with health care professionals (n=4), ethics committee members (n=8), and pharmaceutical industry representatives (n=5) identified the need for an eIC system that can be easily set up. For example, a library could be established enabling stakeholders to easily provide background information about a clinical study, presented in the second layer of the interface. In contrast, some functionalities, such as informing participants about new studies through an eIC system, were not considered useful by stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights for the implementation of a user-friendly personalized and long-term eIC application. The study findings showed that usability testing is key to assessing and increasing the user-friendliness of an eIC application. Although this eIC system has the potential to be usable by a wide audience, participants with low digital literacy may not be able to use it successfully, highlighting the need for additional support for participants or other alternatives to an eIC system.

Transforming this flood of data into effective and efficient diagnosis is a major challenge. METHODS: To address this challenge, we present a 3P approach: personalized patient monitoring, precision diagnostics, and preventive criticality alerts. In a collaborative work with doctors, we present the design, development, and testing of a healthcare data analytics and communication framework that we call RASPRO (Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis). The heart of RASPRO is Physician Assist Filters (PAF) that transform unwieldy multi-sensor time series data into summarized patient/disease specific trends in steps of progressive precision as demanded by the doctor for patient's personalized condition at hand and help in identifying and subsequently predictively alerting the onset of critical conditions. The output of PAFs is a clinically useful, yet extremely succinct summary of a patient's medical condition, represented as a motif, which could be sent to remote doctors even over SMS, reducing the need for data bandwidths. We evaluate the clinical validity of these techniques using SVM machine learning models measuring both the predictive power and its ability to classify disease condition. We used more than 16,000 min of patient data (N=70) from the openly available MIMIC II database for conducting these experiments. Furthermore, we also report the clinical utility of the system through doctor feedback from a large super-speciality hospital in India. RESULTS: The results show that the RASPRO motifs perform as well as (and in many cases better than) raw time series data. In addition, we also see improvement in diagnostic performance using optimized sensor severity threshold ranges set using the personalization PAF severity quantizer. CONCLUSION: The RASPRO-PAF system and the associated techniques are found to be useful in many healthcare applications, especially in remote patient monitoring.

These are often criticised due to lack of external validation, potential for low predictive ability and the use of thresholds that can lead to large numbers being escalated for assessment that would not have an adverse outcome leading to unsuccessful active case management. Evidence supports the importance of clinical judgement in risk prediction particularly when ruling out disease. The aim of this pilot study was to explore performance analysis of a digitally driven risk stratification model combined with GP clinical judgement to identify patients with escalating urgent care and mortality events. METHODS: Clinically risk stratified cohort study of 6 GP practices in a deprived, multi-ethnic UK city. Initial digital driven risk stratification into Escalated and Non-escalated groups used 7 risk factors. The Escalated group underwent stratification using GP global clinical judgement (GCJ) into Concern and No concern groupings. RESULTS: 3968 out of 31,392 patients were data stratified into the Escalated group and further categorised into No concern (n = 3450 (10.9%)) or Concern (n = 518 (1.7%)) by GPs. The 30-day combined event rate (unscheduled care or death) per 1,000 was 19.0 in the whole population, 67.8 in the Escalated group and 168.0 in the Concern group (p < 0.001). The de-escalation effect of GP assessment into No Concern versus Concern was strongly negatively predictive (OR 0.25 (95%CI 0.19-0.33"," p < 0.001)). The whole population ROC for the global approach (Non-escalated, GP No Concern, GP Concern) was 0.614 (0.592-0.637), p < 0.001, and the increase in the ROC area under the curve for 30-day events was all focused here ( 0.4% (0.3-0.6%, p < 0.001), translating into a specific ROC c-statistic for GP GCJ of 0.603 ((0.565-0.642), p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The digital only component of the model performed well but adding GP clinical judgement significantly improved risk prediction, particularly by adding negative predictive value."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-024-02797-5,Humans",Pilot Projects,Risk Assessment/methods,Female,Middle Aged,Male,*General Practitioners,

Identification of the interactions among microbes is an important step towards understand the structure and function of microbial communities, as well as of the impact of microbes on human health and disease. Despite the importance of it, there is not a gold-standard dataset of microbial interactions currently. Traditional approaches such as growth and co-culture analysis need to be performed in the laboratory, which are time-consuming and costly. By providing predicted candidate interactions to experimental verification, computational methods are able to alleviate this problem. Mining microbial interactions from mass medical texts is one type of computational methods. Identification of the named entity of bacteria and related entities from the text is the basis for microbial relation extraction. In the previous work, a system of bacteria named entities recognition based on the dictionary and conditional random field was proposed. However, it is inefficient when dealing with large-scale text. RESULTS: We implemented bacteria named entity recognition on Spark platform and designed experiments for comparison to verify the correctness and validity of the proposed system. The experimental results show that it can achieve higher F-Measure on the comparison of correctness. Moreover, the predicting speed is much faster than the previous version in large-scale biomedical datasets, and the computational efficiency is improved remarkably by about 3.1 to 6.7 times. CONCLUSIONS: The system for bacteria named entity recognition solves the inefficiency of the previous proposed system on large-scale datasets.

This work then discusses the potential transmission mechanisms through which digital technology influences health inequality. Finally, it analyses the heterogeneity effects of digital technology on health inequality across different groups. RESULTS: We find that digital technology has reduced both physical and mental health inequality. Strengthening family support, enhancing health investment, and improving health behaviours are the transmission paths from digital technology to health inequality. Groups with older cohorts, females, less-educated individuals, low-income individuals, and rural individuals benefit more from physical health inequality, whereas the impact of digital technology on mental health inequality does not differ across groups.

PHIIs may push information to a target audience (communication), pull information from the public (surveillance), or combine both in a bidirectional intervention. Although PHIIs have often been framed as non-invasive and ethically innocuous, in reality they may be intrusive into people's lives, affecting not only their health but their senses of security, respect, and self-determination. Ethical acceptability of PHIIs may have impacts on intervention effectiveness, potentially giving rise to unintended consequences. This article examines push, pull, and bidirectional PHIIs using empirical data from an ethnographic study of young mothers in Greater Vancouver, Canada. Data were collected from October 2013 to December 2014 via naturalistic observation and individual interviews with 37 young mothers ages 16-22. Transcribed interviews and field notes were analyzed using inductive qualitative thematic analysis. Both push and pull interventions were experienced as non-neutral by the target population, and implementation factors on a structural and individual scale affected intervention ethics and effectiveness. Based on our findings, we suggest that careful ethical consideration be applied to use of PHIIs as health promotion tools. Advancing the 'ethics of PHIIs' will benefit from empirical data that is informed by information and computer science theory and methods. Information technologies, digital health promotion services, and integrated surveillance programs reflect important areas for investigation in terms of their effects and ethics.

While evidence is emerging, a growing number of rehabilitation facilities are implementing devices, though with variable success. A public-private rehabilitation provider in Australia recently opened a technology therapy centre with robotic and virtual reality devices. This study was embedded in the setting, which saw substantial clinician uptake of devices and presented a unique opportunity to explore clinician experiences, perceptions and factors influencing uptake, implementation and sustainment of advanced technology in practice. METHODS: A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted, involving interviews with clinicians at three timepoints across the first 16 months of the centre opening. Allied health clinicians in the organisation (n = 119) were invited to participate in interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: In total, 63 interviews were conducted with 25 allied health clinicians across inpatient, outpatient and community rehabilitation services. An overarching finding that human interactions remain at the heart of rehabilitation with advanced technology, comprised three major themes with 12 subthemes. (1) Technology integration involves cognitive and emotional labour for clinicians, stemming from determining the value-add of advanced technology, juggling learning demands and negotiating patients' high expectations of technology. (2) Contextual factors shape clinician uptake and ongoing use of technology, including organisational culture, professional discipline, rehabilitation setting, patient characteristics and device features. (3) Shared understanding and priorities promote technology implementation and sustainment, including understanding advanced technology in relation to conventional therapy, creating a well-designed training model, equipping clinicians to manage patient expectations and maintaining a commitment to evidence-based practice. CONCLUSIONS: While further high-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of technology in rehabilitation is required, clinicians in this study perceived advanced technology as an adjunct to conventional therapy, with benefits for enhancing therapy dosage, patient engagement, manual handling and providing objective feedback. Important practice-derived considerations for integrating advanced technologies in rehabilitation include: developing clinician technical, clinical reasoning and interpersonal skills, reducing contextual barriers and fostering a positive organisational culture with strong leadership and targeted initiatives to support clinicians. Successful implementation of advanced rehabilitation technologies relies on clinician buy-in to champion change within an enabling person-centered context."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12984-025-01576-1,Humans",*Qualitative Research,Longitudinal Studies,*Allied Health Personnel/psychology,Female,Male,Robotics,Attitude of Health Personnel,

The purpose of this study was to identify the domains and items of digital professionalism related to social media use and to validate a self-assessment instrument to assess the digital professionalism of HCPs using social media. METHODS: An instrument development multiphase mixed method study (exploratory sequential) was conducted in two phases: item development and qualitative content validation followed by validation of the instrument. Feedback was taken from 15 experts for qualitative content validation in phase 1. In phase 2, content validity was established through three rounds of modified Delphi. Validity evidence was collected for the content (content validity index), response process (cognitive interviews), internal structure (confirmatory factor analysis), and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha). RESULTS: The 48-item preliminary instrument was reduced to a 28-item instrument with eight domains: self-anonymity, privacy settings, maintenance of boundaries and confidentiality, conflict of interest, accountability, respect for colleagues, and ethics. The content validity index of the scale was 0.91. The reliability and construct validity of the instrument was established by responses from 500 healthcare professionals from multiple hospitals.

Nineteen radiologists participated. Conventional procedures (CT group) were compared with procedures assisted by a navigation system prototype using an electromagnetic localizer to track the position and orientation of a needle holder (NAV group). The navigation system displays the needle path in real-time on 2D reconstructed CT images extracted from the 3D CT volume.

While eHealth indicators may measure the transition from institution-centered (e.g., hospital-centered) information processing to patient-centered information processing, collecting relevant and timely data for such indicators has been difficult. OBJECTIVES: This article aims to design some basic eHealth indicators, which are easily collected and measure how well information processing supports holistic patient-centered health care, and to evaluate penetrance of patient-centered health as measured by the indicators internationally via an expert survey. METHODS: We identified six basic indicators that measure access of health care professionals, patients, and caregivers to the patient's health record data and the ability of providers, patients, and caregivers to add information in the patient's record. In a survey of international informatics experts, these indicators' penetrance were evaluated for Austria, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, South Korea, Sweden, and the United States in the summer of 2017. RESULTS: The eHealth status measured by the indicators varied significantly between these seven countries.

This occurred at different levels, such as using their own experience when giving presentations and lectures to health care professionals and medical students, working as professional peers in clinical settings, performing self-tracking, contributing with innovations, and being active on social media. When interaction with health care providers was perceived as being insufficient, the participants sought support through their peers, which showed strong relatedness. Competence increased through the use of technology and learning experiences with peers. Their autonomy was important but was sometimes described as involuntary and to give up was not an option for them. CONCLUSIONS: Like the first generation of e-patients, the participants frequently searched for Web-based information. However, the second generation of e-patients also produce their own health data, which they learn from and share. They also engage in the innovation of digital tools to meet health-related needs. Utilizing technological developments comes naturally to the second generation of e-patients, even if the health care system is not prepared to support them under these new circumstances."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/13022,Adult",Aged,*Caregivers,Chronic Disease/*psychology,Female,Humans,*Information Seeking Behavior,Interviews as Topic,

This qualitative study used expert interviews to define AI-related clinical competencies for health care professionals. METHOD: In 2021, a multidisciplinary team interviewed 15 experts in the use of AI-based tools in health care settings about the clinical competencies health care professionals need to work effectively with such tools. Transcripts of the semistructured interviews were coded and thematically analyzed. Draft competency statements were developed and provided to the experts for feedback. The competencies were finalized using a consensus process across the research team. RESULTS: Six competency domain statements and 25 subcompetencies were formulated from the thematic analysis. The competency domain statements are: (1) basic knowledge of AI: explain what AI is and describe its health care applications"," (2) social and ethical implications of AI: explain how social, economic, and political systems influence AI-based tools and how these relationships impact justice, equity, and ethics", (3) AI-enhanced clinical encounters: carry out AI-enhanced clinical encounters that integrate diverse sources of information in creating patient-centered care plans," (4) evidence-based evaluation of AI-based tools: evaluate the quality, accuracy, safety, contextual appropriateness, and biases of AI-based tools and their underlying data sets in providing care to patients and populations"," (5) workflow analysis for AI-based tools: analyze and adapt to changes in teams, roles, responsibilities, and workflows resulting from implementation of AI-based tools"," and (6) practice-based learning and improvement regarding AI-based tools: participate in continuing professional development and practice-based improvement activities related to use of AI tools in health care. CONCLUSIONS: The 6 clinical competencies identified can be used to guide future teaching and learning programs to maximize the potential benefits of AI-based tools and diminish potential harms."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1097/ACM.0000000000004963,Humans",*Artificial Intelligence,*Learning,

Most tools developed to foster ethical practices lack rigor and do not concurrently capture the health, social, economic, and environmental issues that such solutions raise. OBJECTIVE: To support clinical leadership in this field, we aimed to develop a comprehensive, valid, and reliable tool that measures the responsibility of DAI solutions by adapting the multidimensional and already validated Responsible Innovation in Health Tool. METHODS: We conducted a 3-phase mixed methods study. Relying on a scoping review of available tools, phase 1 (concept mapping) led to a preliminary version of the Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool. In phase 2, an international 2-round e-Delphi expert panel rated on a 5-level scale the importance, clarity, and appropriateness of the tool's components. In phase 3, a total of 2 raters independently applied the revised tool to a sample of DAI solutions (n=25), interrater reliability was measured, and final minor changes were made to the tool. RESULTS: The mapping process identified a comprehensive set of responsibility premises, screening criteria, and assessment attributes specific to DAI solutions. e-Delphi experts critically assessed these new components and provided comments to increase content validity (n=293), and after round 2, consensus was reached on 85% (22/26) of the items surveyed. Interrater agreement was substantial for a subcriterion and almost perfect for all other criteria and assessment attributes. CONCLUSIONS: The Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool offers a comprehensive, valid, and reliable means of assessing the degree of responsibility of DAI solutions in health.

This may lead to bias in the diagnosis or treatment due to the misunderstanding or incomplete understanding. To solve the issue, a consumer health vocabulary was developed to map the consumer-used health terms to professional-used medical terms. METHODS: In this study, we extracted Chinese consumer health terms from both online health forum and patient education monographs, and manually mapped them to medical terms used by professionals (terms in medical thesauri or in medical books). To ensure the above annotation quality, we developed annotation guidelines. RESULTS: We applied our method to extract consumer-used disease terms in endocrinology, cardiology, gastroenterology and dermatology. In this study, we identified 1349 medical mentions from 8436 questions posted in an online health forum and 1428 articles for patient education monographs. After manual annotation and review, we released 1036 Chinese consumer health terms with mapping to 480 medical terms. Four annotators worked on the manual annotation work following the Chinese consumer health term annotation guidelines. Their average inter-annotator agreement (IAA) score was 93.91% ensuring high consistency of the released terms. CONCLUSIONS: We extracted Chinese consumer health terms from online forum and patient education monographs, and mapped them to medical terms used by professionals. Manual annotation efforts have been made for term annotating and mapping. Our study may contribute to the Chinese consumer health vocabulary construction.

METHODS: We applied discrete-event simulation modelling. The model was populated with real world data from a university hospital with a strong focus on reducing waiting time to surgery for patients with hip fracture. The system modelled concerned two patient groups that share the same OR resources: hip-fracture and other non-elective orthopaedic patients in need of surgical treatment. We simulated three scenarios based on the literature and interaction with staff and managers: (1) baseline"," (2) reduced turnover time between surgeries by 20 min and (3) one extra OR during the day, Monday to Friday. The outcome variables were waiting time to surgery and the percentage of patients who waited longer than 24 hours for surgery. RESULTS: The mean waiting time in hours was significantly reduced from 16.2 hours in scenario 1 (baseline) to 13.3 hours in scenario 2 and 13.6 hours in scenario 3 for hip-fracture surgery and from 26.0 hours in baseline to 18.9 hours in scenario 2 and 18.5 hours in scenario 3 for other non-elective patients. The percentage of patients who were treated within 24 hours significantly increased from 86.4% (baseline) to 96.1% (scenario 2) and 95.1% (scenario 3) for hip-fracture patients and from 60.2% (baseline) to 79.8% (scenario 2) and 79.8% (scenario 3) for patients with other non-elective patients. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare managers who strive to improve the timelines of non-elective orthopaedic surgeries may benefit from using simulation modelling to analyse different strategies to support their decisions.

Especially direct-to-consumer self-testing app companies mobilise the term to advertise their products, which allow users to self-test for various medical conditions independent of healthcare professionals. This article first demonstrates the absence of empowerment conceptualisations in the context of self-testing apps by engaging with empowerment literature. It then contrasts the service these apps provide with two widely cited empowerment definitions by the WHO, which describe the term as a process that, broadly, leads to knowledge and control of health decisions. We conclude that self-testing apps can only partly empower their users, as they, we argue, do not provide the type of knowledge and control the WHO definitions describe. More importantly, we observe that this shortcoming stems from the fact that in the literature on mHealth and in self-testing marketing, empowerment is understood as a goal rather than a process. This characterises a shift in the meaning of empowerment in the context of self-testing and mHealth, one that reveals a lack of awareness for relational and contextual factors that contribute to empowerment. We argue that returning to a process-understanding of empowerment helps to identify these apps' deficits, and we conclude the article by briefly suggesting several strategies to increase self-testing apps' empowerment function."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11019-022-10132-w,Humans",*Mobile Applications,Self-Testing,*Telemedicine,"Health Personnel,36592301,PMC9806806",,,,

A WHO-led multi-country research project aims to develop and validate two tools (labor observation and community survey) to measure how women are treated during facility-based childbirth. This paper describes the development process for these measurement tools, and how they were implemented in a multi-country study (Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria). METHODS: An iterative mixed-methods approach was used to develop two measurement tools. Methodological development was conducted in four steps: (1) initial tool development"," (2) validity testing, item adjustment and piloting of paper-based tools"," (3) conversion to digital, tablet-based tools"," and (4) data collection and analysis. These steps included systematic reviews, primary qualitative research, mapping of existing tools, item consolidation, peer review by key stakeholders and piloting.

SCAs ask users questions about their symptoms via a chatbot, give a list with possible causes, and provide a recommendation, such as seeing a physician. However, it is unclear whether the actual performance of a SCA corresponds to the users' experiences. This qualitative study investigates the subjective perspectives of SCA users to close the empirical gap identified in the literature and answers the following main research question: How do individuals (healthy users and patients) experience the usage of SCA, including their attitudes, expectations, motivations, and concerns regarding their SCA use? METHODS: A qualitative interview study was chosen to clarify the relatively unknown experience of SCA use. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with SCA users were carried out by two researchers in tandem via video call. Qualitative content analysis was selected as methodology for the data analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen interviews with SCA users were conducted and seven main categories identified: (1) Attitudes towards findings and recommendations, (2) Communication, (3) Contact with physicians, (4) Expectations (prior to use), (5) Motivations, (6) Risks, and (7) SCA-use for others. CONCLUSIONS: The aspects identified in the analysis emphasise the specific perspective of SCA users and, at the same time, the immense scope of different experiences.

METHODS: We worked with i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) Obesity Challenge data. Two experiments were constructed. In the first one, only one UMLS concept related with the diseases annotated was extracted. In the second, some UMLS concepts were aggregated. RESULTS: Results were evaluated with manually annotated medical entities. With the aggregation process the result shows a better improvement. MetaMap had an average of 0.88 in recall, 0.89 in precision, and 0.88 in F-score. With cTAKES, the average of recall, precision and F-score were 0.91, 0.89, and 0.89, respectively.

In order for eHealth solutions to be adopted in daily practice, is it essential to assess healthcare professionals' attitudes toward its usefulness. As this is currently lacking, this study explores the use of eHealth in daily practice, opportunities of eHealth, implementation barriers, and desired functions and features amongst healthcare professionals working in Dutch orthopedic surgery and traumatology. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey among the 605 members of the Dutch Society of Trauma Surgery and related healthcare professionals on the attitudes towards eHealth in daily practice was performed between November 4, 2021, and March 31, 2022. The survey consisted of five sections with 42 questions, including close-ended questions, multiple-choice questions, 5-point Likert Scales, Visual Analogue Scales, and free-text questions. RESULTS: Of the 111 responding healthcare professionals, 59/111 (53%) were male, and the median age was 40 years (IQR 26 to 67). Almost all participants owned smartphones (109/111, 98.2%). Most participants reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had influenced their attitude towards the usefulness of eHealth positively (80/111, 72%). Most participants (59%) would use a digital alternative instead of face-to-face follow-up if proven a safe technology, and expect that 64% of all patients would prefer a digital option. Most healthcare professionals stated that eHealth could reduce healthcare costs (94/111, 85%) and improve patient satisfaction (81/111, 73%) but is hindered most by a lack of financial support during implementation (57/111, 51%), followed by complex laws and regulations (54/111, 49%). DISCUSSION: Results of this cross-sectional survey show that attitudes of orthopedic surgery or traumatology-related healthcare professionals toward the usefulness of eHealth are positive and may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though healthcare professionals believe eHealth could reduce costs and improve patient satisfaction, daily clinical use remains low possibly due to a lack of long-term and short-term financial support and complex laws and regulations."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-024-11259-7,Humans",Cross-Sectional Studies,Male,Female,Netherlands,Adult,

Clinical decision support systems have the potential to assist in such decisions but will be dependent on the data quality in electronic health records which often is inadequate. This study explores the effect of automated documentation of vital signs on data quality and workload. METHODS: An observational study of 200 vital sign measurements was performed to evaluate the effects of manual vs automatic documentation on data quality. Data collection using questionnaires was performed to compare the workload on wards using manual or automatic documentation. RESULTS: In the automated documentation time to documentation was reduced by 6.1 min (0.6 min vs 7.7 min, p <  0.05) and completeness increased (98% vs 95%, p <  0.05). Regarding workflow temporal demands were lower in the automatic documentation workflow compared to the manual group (50 vs 23, p <  0.05). The same was true for frustration level (64 vs 33, p <  0.05). The experienced reduction in temporal demands was in line with the anticipated, whereas the experienced reduction in frustration was lower than the anticipated (27 vs 54, p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: The study shows that automatic documentation will improve the currency and the completeness of vital sign data in the Electronic Health Record while reducing workload regarding temporal demands and experienced frustration. The study also shows that these findings are in line with staff anticipations but indicates that the anticipations on the reduction of frustration may be exaggerated among the staff.

The present study explores how home healthcare professionals had experienced the introduction of digital medicine dispensers and their influence on patient-caregiver relationships. METHODS: The multi-case study comprised semi-structured interviews with 21 healthcare professionals whose home healthcare service involved using the digital medicine dispensers. The constant comparative method was used for data analyses. RESULTS: Altogether, interviewed healthcare professionals reported three main technology-related impacts upon their patient-caregiver relationships. First, national and local pressure to increase efficiency had troubled their relationships with patients who suspected that municipalities have sought to lower costs by reducing and digitalising services. Participants reported having to consider such worries when introducing technologies into their services. Second, participants reported a shift towards empowering patients. Digital technology can empower patients who value their independence, whereas safety is more important for other patients. Healthcare professionals needed to ensure that replacing care tasks with technology implies safe and improved care. Third, the safety and quality of digital healthcare services continues to depend upon surveillance and control mechanisms that compensate for less face-to-face monitoring. Participants did not consider the possibility that surveillance exposes information about patients' everyday lives to be problematic, but to constitute opportunities for adjusting services to meet patients' needs. CONCLUSIONS: Technologies such as digital medicine dispensers can improve the efficiency of healthcare services and enhance patients' independence when introduced in a way that empowers patients as well as safeguards trust and service quality. Conversely, the patient-caregiver relationship can suffer if the technology does not meet patients' needs and fails to offer safe and trustworthy services. Upon introducing technology, home healthcare professionals therefore need to carefully consider the benefits and possible disadvantages of the technology. Ethical implications for both individuals and societies need to be further discussed."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-2835-1,Attitude to Computers",Communication,Female,Health Services Accessibility/*standards,Home Care Services/*standards,*Home Health Aides/psychology,Humans,Male,

However, acquiring image domain annotations is challenging due to the knowledge and commitment required of expert pathologists. Pathologists often identify regions in whole slide images with diagnostic relevance rather than examining the entire slide, with a positive correlation between the time spent on these critical image regions and diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, a heatmap is generated to represent pathologists' viewing patterns during diagnosis and used to guide a deep learning architecture during training. The proposed system outperforms traditional approaches based on color and texture image characteristics, integrating pathologists' domain expertise to enhance region of interest detection without needing individual case annotations. Evaluating our best model, a U-Net model with a pre-trained ResNet-18 encoder, on a skin biopsy whole slide image dataset for melanoma diagnosis, shows its potential in detecting regions of interest, surpassing conventional methods with an increase of 20%, 11%, 22%, and 12% in precision, recall, F1-score, and Intersection over Union, respectively. In a clinical evaluation, three dermatopathologists agreed on the model's effectiveness in replicating pathologists' diagnostic viewing behavior and accurately identifying critical regions. Finally, our study demonstrates that incorporating heatmaps as supplementary signals can enhance the performance of computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs. METHODS: Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority (n = 855, 82%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader (n = 829, 78%) and work-flow optimization (n = 802, 77%). Ethical and legal issues (n = 630, 62%) and lack of knowledge (n = 584, 57%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority (n = 819, 79%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found (n = 241, 23%).

However, in the Electronic Health Record, data related to many social risk factors are primarily recorded in free-text clinical notes, rather than as more readily computable structured data, and hence cannot currently be easily incorporated into automated assessments of health. In this paper, we present Moonstone, a new, highly configurable rule-based clinical natural language processing system designed to automatically extract information that requires inferencing from clinical notes. Our initial use case for the tool is focused on the automatic extraction of social risk factor information - in this case, housing situation, living alone, and social support - from clinical notes. Nursing notes, social work notes, emergency room physician notes, primary care notes, hospital admission notes, and discharge summaries, all derived from the Veterans Health Administration, were used for algorithm development and evaluation. RESULTS: An evaluation of Moonstone demonstrated that the system is highly accurate in extracting and classifying the three variables of interest (housing situation, living alone, and social support). The system achieved positive predictive value (i.e. precision) scores ranging from 0.66 (homeless/marginally housed) to 0.98 (lives at home/not homeless), accuracy scores ranging from 0.63 (lives in facility) to 0.95 (lives alone), and sensitivity (i.e. recall) scores ranging from 0.75 (lives in facility) to 0.97 (lives alone). CONCLUSIONS: The Moonstone system is - to the best of our knowledge - the first freely available, open source natural language processing system designed to extract social risk factors from clinical text with good (lives in facility) to excellent (lives alone) performance. Although developed with the social risk factor identification task in mind, Moonstone provides a powerful tool to address a range of clinical natural language processing tasks, especially those tasks that require nuanced linguistic processing in conjunction with inference capabilities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13326-019-0198-0,Health",Humans,*Natural Language Processing,Risk Factors,"*Social Environment,30975223,PMC6458709",,,,

Various interventions and working documents have also been developed and implemented targeting the different aspects of the HIS program. However, there is no nationally designed accountability framework to govern HIS activities. Besides, how health institutions follow and monitor HIS activities is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the practice and barriers of HIS accountability framework at the selected public health institutions. METHOD: A descriptive qualitative study design was employed from June 05 to July 12, 2023. Purposively selected informants from public health institutions were recruited for key informant interviews. A prepared pilot-tested semi-structured interview guide was used. The conventional content approach was used to summarize and synthesize the information explored. FINDINGS: The study revealed that most respondents described the concept and advantages of the HIS accountability framework in different ways. The participants believed the HIS accountability framework would help to govern and manage behavioral-related HIS challenges. It was indicated that the framework will help to control the recurrence of HIS errors, enhance the commitment and adherence of health professionals, and improve data handover practice, data security and privacy, data quality, informed decision, and finality quality of care. Lack of national guidelines on the HIS accountability framework, the poor culture of accountability, multiple responsibilities and workload, high staff and leadership turnover, lack of motivation, and security problems were stated barriers to implementation of the HIS accountability framework. It was suggested to create a conducive work environment, engage health professionals and other actors during the intervention development, build the skills on HIS leadership, and have the national HIS accountability framework document to implement the intervention effectively. CONCLUSIONS: Even if there is a better understanding of the concept and advantages of the HIS accountability framework, its practice across the system is limited.

It does not only provide knowledge for good clinical conduct, but also trains medical students as virtuous practitioners. Although Turkey has had a considerable experience in ethics education of healthcare professionals, the general state of ethics curricula at medical schools in Turkey is unknown. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to collect comprehensive data about the ethics education programs at medical schools in Turkey. To this aim, we designed a cross-sectional descriptive questionnaire survey which focuses on the content, teaching years, teaching, assessment and evaluation methodologies, workforce and infrastructure. We delivered the questionnaire to all medical schools in Turkey. Seventy-nine medical schools participated in this study (response rate: 78%). RESULTS: Although most institutions had an undergraduate ethics curriculum (91.1%), the findings suggest deficiency of teaching personnel (34.2% had no instructors). Furthermore, the distribution and composition of the workforce was imbalanced. The content varies largely among institutions. Medical schools with an ethics department were more likely to diversify teaching topics. However, ethics education was largely based on the four-principle approach. The content was usually conveyed to students theoretically. Around 90% of schools had classroom lectures. It is the only method used at one-third of them. Clinical ethics education was mostly lacking. Multiple-choice tests were widely used to assess and evaluate student attainments (86.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Staff qualified to teach ethics and ethics education integrated into the six-year medical curriculum given by a multidisciplinary team are urgent necessities. Considering teaching, assessment and evaluation methodologies used, most medical schools seem to fall short of fostering students to develop ethical attitudes. Endeavors aiming for modern topics should be encouraged. As the organization ethics education change continuously, we think that a platform for monitoring ethics education at medical schools in Turkey should be established.

The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until """"everything is connected to everything else"""" poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her/his connected surrogates. We propose Industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are orthogonal-in that they allow """"digital detox"""" by employing pathways unrelated/unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material/article trails on vital medical information", (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent," and (3) next generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global governance of emerging technologies: """"Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation Research"""" (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology policymaking.

The aims of this study were to: identify the support and resources GPs need to manage urgent care patients in the community", assess the need for GP advice lines by primary care services in Australia," and identify the facilitators and barriers to adoption, and strategies to support the sustainability of GP advice lines. METHODS: Qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with GPs, hospital-based healthcare providers, consumers, and healthcare management, recruited via existing investigator networks and snowballing approach. The interviews were conducted between February and August 2023. Major themes were identified by an iterative and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We interviewed 16 participants (median age 50, IQR 38-59). Based on the aims of the study, three themes emerged: support and resources for GPs", motivation for GP advice lines," and factors influencing the uptake and sustainability of GP advice lines. Participants reported that better communication from hospital services with GPs is critical to ensure continuity of care between tertiary and primary settings. They also noted that GP advice lines can help increase capacity to manage urgent care patients in the community by providing timely decision-support to GPs. However, a reported barrier to the uptake and ongoing use of GP advice lines was the limited hours of the service. To sustain GP advice lines, participants highlighted a need to broaden the scope of the service beyond the pandemic, conduct rigorous evaluation on health outcomes, and further digitise the service so that a tiered level of support could be provided based on risk stratification. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of GP advice lines are yet to be fully realised. With increasing technology sophistication, there remain opportunities to further digitise and optimise GP advice lines, whilst ensuring better integration within and across primary and tertiary care services.

However death rates are anticipated to increase given the ageing population and chronic disease progression. Being able to talk about death is seen to be important in normalising death as part of life and supporting preparedness for death. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide opportunities for the community to engage in collaborative learning. A 5 week MOOC was developed covering four main topics (language and humour, representations of death, medicalisation of dying, and digital dying) aiming: To enable participants to openly and supportively discuss and learn about issues around living, death and dying, To explore the normally unheard opinions and views of Australians around death and dying, and To determine what effect online learning and discussions offered through the MOOC had on participants' feelings and attitudes towards death and dying. METHODS: Data was captured on engagement rates in the various MOOC activities. Death Attitudes were measured by five items representing the MOOC's learning objectives and completed at enrolment and conclusion. MOOC Satisfaction was measured with six items at the end of the MOOC. Descriptive statistics were produced for each variable and Chi-Square Tests of Independence assessed the extent of the relationship between categorical variables. Socio-demographic variables were examined as predictors of the outcome variables of MOOC engagement, MOOC satisfaction, and death attitudes. Ethical approval was received from Flinders University Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee (Project No. 7247). RESULTS: One thousand one hundred fifty six people enrolled in the Dying2Learn MOOC with 895 participating in some way. Enrolees were primarily female (92.1%). Age ranged from 16 to 84 (mean = 49.5, SD = 12.3). MOOC satisfaction scores were high.

However, in an era of rapid change in medicine, we believe it is time to update the Oath with modest but meaningful additions so that it optimally reflects 21st century health care. The rise of digital health has dramatically changed the practice of medicine in a way that could not have been easily predicted at the time Hippocrates outlined his ethical principles of medicine.

Whereas personalized and precision medicine involve similar analytical methods applied to genomic and medical record data, systems medicine draws on these as well as other sources of data. Given this distinction, the clinical translation of systems medicine poses a number of important ethical and epistemological challenges for researchers working to generate systems medicine knowledge and clinicians working to apply it. DISCUSSION: This article focuses on three key challenges: First, we will discuss the conflicts in decision-making that can arise when healthcare providers committed to principles of experimental medicine or evidence-based medicine encounter individualized recommendations derived from computer algorithms. We will explore in particular whether controlled experiments, such as comparative effectiveness trials, should mediate the translation of systems medicine, or if instead individualized findings generated through """"big data"""" approaches can be applied directly in clinical decision-making. Second, we will examine the case of the Riyadh Intensive Care Program Mortality Prediction Algorithm, pejoratively referred to as the """"death computer,"""" to demonstrate the ethical challenges that can arise when big-data-driven scoring systems are applied in clinical contexts. We argue that the uncritical use of predictive clinical algorithms, including those envisioned for systems medicine, challenge basic understandings of the doctor-patient relationship. Third, we will build on the recent discourse on secondary findings in genomics and imaging to draw attention to the important implications of secondary findings derived from the joint analysis of data from diverse sources, including data recorded by patients in an attempt to realize their """"quantified self."""" This paper examines possible ethical challenges that are likely to be raised as systems medicine to be translated into clinical medicine. These include the epistemological challenges for clinical decision-making, the use of scoring systems optimized by big data techniques and the risk that incidental and secondary findings will significantly increase.

However, in order to enable DNA data storage technologies there needs to be improvements in data storage fidelity (tolerance to mutation), the facility of writing and reading the data (biases and systematic error arising from synthesis and sequencing), and overall scalability. RESULTS: To this end, we have developed and implemented an encoding scheme that is suitable for detecting and correcting errors that may arise during storage, writing, and reading, such as those arising from nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions. We propose a scheme for parallelized long term storage of encoded sequences that relies on overlaps rather than the address blocks found in previously published work. Using computer simulations, we illustrate the encoding, sequencing, decoding, and recovery of encoded information, ultimately demonstrating the possibility of a successful round-trip read/write. These demonstrations show that in theory a precise control over error tolerance is possible. Even after simulated degradation of DNA, recovery of original data is possible owing to the error correction capabilities built into the encoding strategy. A secondary advantage of our method is that the statistical characteristics (such as repetitiveness and GC-composition) of encoded sequences can also be tailored without sacrificing the overall ability to store large amounts of data. Finally, the combination of the overlap-based partitioning of data with the LZMA compression that is integral to encoding means that the entire sequence must be present for successful decoding. This feature enables inordinately strong encryptions. As a potential application, an encrypted pathogen genome could be distributed and carried by cells without danger of being expressed, and could not even be read out in the absence of the entire DNA consortium. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a method for DNA encoding, using a significantly different fundamental approach from existing work, which often performs better than alternatives and allows for a great deal of freedom and flexibility of application."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12896-018-0476-4,""Animals",Cats/genetics,DNA/genetics,"Databases, Nucleic Acid",Genome,Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods,"*Libraries, Digital","Sequence Analysis, DNA"",30333005,PMC6191901",

METHOD: Case studies conducted by semi-structured interview, using the Normalization Process Theory (NPT) as a framework for thematic analysis. Twenty three interviews with physicians, nurses, hospital staff and stakeholders were conducted at: 1) CapitalCare Medical Group in Albany, New York"," 2) HealthPartners Clinics in Minneapolis, Minnesota. RESULTS: 'Coherent' motivations were guided by financial incentives at CapitalCare, and by a 'champion' physician at HealthPartners. Nurses worked 'collectively' at both settings and played an important role at sites where successful implementation occurred. Some physicians did not understand the perceived utility of Option Grid?, which led to varying degrees of implementation success across sites. The appraisal work (reflexive monitoring) identified benefits, particularly in terms of information provision. Physicians at both settings, however, were concerned with time pressures and the suitability of the tool for patients with low levels of health literacy.

Reviewing treatment record is an important quality assurance (QA) task for safety and quality of patient treatments. This task is usually performed by senior medical physicists. However, it is time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. To assist this process, a treatment record review system (TRRS) is developed to automatically review items related to treatment delivery record. METHODS: The treatment record is firstly extracted from oncology information system (OIS). Based on the daily patient treatment information, the original plan from the treatment planning system is identified. Then the original plan and the delivered plan are correlated. Eight review categories (parameter consistency, treatment completeness, treatment progression, image guidance, override, treatment couch, documentation, and treatment mode) are created. Tailored rules are designed for various review items to automate the review process. As a result, for each daily treatment record, a reviewed flag (pass, failure, warning, and N/A) is assigned by the TRRS. Finally, this system is evaluated by 6 months patient treatment records collected in our institute and compared to the manual process on the same data. RESULTS: TRRS processed a total of 76,651 treatment fractions from 4230 patients with an average of 574 treatments per day. The percentage of the detected anomalies among the total records was 0.76%. The average processing time was 3.9 s and 282 s per treatment record for the automatic and manual processes, respectively. Comparing with the manual process, the time efficiency of TRRS is improved by a factor of 72. The average numbers of anomalies detected by the automatic and manual processes are 21 and 13 per day, respectively. TRRS detects 61.5% more anomalies than those of the manual process. CONCLUSION: TRRS is not only efficient in processing a large amount of treatment records on a daily basis but also effective in finding more anomalies than those of physics weekly check. The application of the TRRS could significantly reduce the workload of the review physicists and let them focus on more important works related to patient safety."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13014-024-02582-8,""Humans","*Quality Assurance, Health Care/standards","*Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/methods/standards",Neoplasms/radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy/standards/methods"",39815353,PMC11734561",,,,

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of (a) the published scientific literature on CDW and (b) publicly available information on CDW data access, e.g., data access policies. A qualitative thematic analysis was applied to all included literature and policies. RESULTS: Twenty-three scientific publications and one policy document were included in the final analysis. The qualitative analysis led to a final set of three main thematic categories: (1) requirements, including recipient requirements, reuse requirements, and formal requirements"," (2) structures and processes, including review bodies and review values"," and (3) access, including access limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The description of data access and use governance in the scientific literature is characterized by a high level of heterogeneity and ambiguity. In practice, this might limit the effective data sharing needed to fulfil the high expectations of data-intensive approaches in medical research and health care. The lack of publicly available information on access policies conflicts with ethical requirements linked to principles of transparency and accountability. CDW should publicly disclose by whom and under which conditions data can be accessed, and provide designated governance structures and policies to increase transparency on data access. The results of this review may contribute to the development of practice-oriented minimal standards for the governance of data access, which could also result in a stronger harmonization, efficiency, and effectiveness of CDW."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-020-01177-z,*Biomedical Research",Confidentiality,*Data Warehousing,Delivery of Health Care,Humans,"Policy,32652989,PMC7353743",

By providing increased and anytime access to information, opportunities to exchange experiences with others, and self-management support, eHealth has been heralded as transformational. It has created a group of informed, engaged, and empowered patients as partners, equipped to take part in shared decision making and effectively self-manage chronic illness. Less attention has been given to health care professionals' (HCPs) experiences of the role of eHealth in patient encounters. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine HCPs' perspectives on how eHealth affects their relationships with patients living with multiple chronic conditions, as well as its ethical and practical ramifications. METHODS: We interviewed HCPs about their experiences with eHealth and its impact on the office visit. Eligible participants needed to report a caseload of =25% of patients with multimorbidity to address issues of managing complex chronic conditions and coordination of care. We used a semistructured discussion guide for in-depth interviews, and follow-up interviews served to clarify and expand upon initial discussions. Constant comparisons and a narrative approach guided the analyses, and a relational ethics conceptual lens was applied to the data to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: A total of 12 physicians and nurses (6 male, 6 female"," median years of practice=13) participated. eHealth tools most frequently described were Web-based educational resources for patients and Web-based resources for HCPs such as curated scientific summaries on diagnostic criteria, clinical therapies, and dosage calculators. Analysis centered on a grand theme of the two-way conversation between HCPs and patients, which addresses a general recentering of the ethical relationship between HCPs and patients around engagement. Subthemes explain the evolution of the two-way conversation, and having, using, and supporting the two-way conversation with patients, primarily as this relates to achieving adherence and health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging ethical concerns were related to the ambiguity of the ideal of empowered patients and the ways in which health professionals described enacting those ideals in practice, showing how the cultural shift toward truly mutually respectful and collaborative practice is in transition. HCPs aim to act in the best interests of their patients"," the challenge is to benefit from emergent technologies that may enhance patient-HCP interactions and effective care, while abiding by regulations, dealing with the strictures of the technology itself, and managing changing demands on their time."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/jmir.8983,Female",Health Personnel/*psychology,Humans,Interviews as Topic,Male,Multimorbidity/*trends,

With clinical photography established for skin surveillance and documentation purposes as well as progress checks, dermatology is an ideal field for the development and application of emerging machine learning health care applications (ML-HCAs). To date, several ML-HCAs have detected malignant skin lesions on par with experts or found overlooked visual patterns that correlate with certain dermatological diseases. However, it is well established that ML-HCAs come with ethical and social implications. OBJECTIVES: Currently, there is a lack of research that establishes model design, training, usage and regulation of such technologies sufficient to ensure ethically and socially responsible development and clinical translation, specifically within the field of dermatology. With this paper, we aim to give an overview of currently discussed ethical issues relating to dermatological ML-HCAs. METHODS: On the basis of a thematic, keyword-based literature search, we performed an ethical analysis against established frameworks of biomedical ethics. We combined our results with current, relevant normative machine learning ethics literature to identify the status quo of the ethics of ML-HCAs in dermatology. We describe the benefits and risks of dermatological ML-HCAs that are currently being developed for clinical purposes. RESULTS: The potential benefits range from better patient outcomes to better knowledge accessibility to decreasing health care disparities, that is, standards of care between different population groups. The risks associated with ML-HCAs range from confidentiality issues to individual patient outcomes as well as the exacerbation of prevalent health care disparities. We discuss the practical implications for all stages of dermatological ML-HCA development. CONCLUSION: We found that ML-HCAs present stakeholder-specific risks for patients, health care professionals and society, which need to be considered separately. The discipline lacks sufficient biomedical ethics research that could standardize the approach to ML-HCA model design, training, use and regulation of such technologies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1111/jdv.18192,Delivery of Health Care",*Ethical Analysis,*Health Personnel,Humans,Machine Learning,"Risk Assessment,35490413,",,,

The introduction of an electronic medical certification of cause of death (eMCCD) system may offer opportunities to improve both the quality and timeliness of this information. METHODS: This study used an exploratory mixed methods design to investigate perceptions surrounding an electronic solution for registering deaths in South Africa. We conducted 14 key informant interviews from 23 key informants invited, surveyed 208 out of 250 targeted health workers and engaged with more than 500 South African health professionals in a participatory workshop about the acceptability of introducing an eMCCD. Mentimeter was used to obtain feedback from the participants. Rapid qualitative analysis methods were used to analyse the key informant interviews and descriptive statistics for the survey and workshop data. During the interpretation phase, qualitative and quantitative data were integrated according to key themes that emerged from the data. RESULTS: During the qualitative interviews, the underlying factors mentioned as contributing to inadequate mortality data quality included insufficient MCCD training, diseases subjected to stigma, limited access to and quality of patient health information, and a significant proportion of deaths occurring outside medical facilities. More than 80.8% of the surveyed health professionals (168/208) rated the importance of mortality statistics as high, but the current quality was rated as low or very low by 29.3% (61/208). An eMCCD appeared to be acceptable to most workshop participants who registered on Mentimeter and was perceived as a means to strengthen the timeliness of mortality information. However, 43.0% (68/158) of the workshop participants who responded to this question on Mentimeter saw poor internet use as the main barrier to introducing an online system. CONCLUSIONS: Our results shed light on critical aspects surrounding cause of death information in South Africa, as well as the challenges faced in maintaining the quality of such data. The findings suggest that the implementation of an eMCCD system could provide opportunities to strengthen the cause of death information in South Africa if it is designed to integrate into the current system and provide supplementary functionalities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12961-024-01275-8,Humans",South Africa,*Death Certificates,*Cause of Death,*Health Personnel,*Vital Statistics,Data Accuracy,Qualitative Research,

AIM: This novel study explores the awareness of southern African anatomy educators regarding the provenance and ethical use of human material in digital resources for E-learning purposes. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Anatomy educators (both members and non-members of the Anatomical Society of Southern Africa including postgraduate students in anatomy) located in 15 health sciences facilities in southern Africa were asked to participate in the survey which consisted of an anonymous, cross-sectional, questionnaire conducted on an online research data system, REDCap. RESULTS: While 52% of respondents used E-learning resources sourced from their own departments for teaching, only 58% of these had knowledge of the provenance of the human material used. Of the 72% of respondents using images from external E-learning resources, 64% did not know the provenance of the human material in these resources. Some southern African anatomists considered anonymity as equivalent to informed consent. Regarding the acceptability of unclaimed bodies for online images, 37% of respondents were against the use of these bodies, while 20% indicated that it was acceptable. Personal internal moral conflict was acknowledged regarding the use of material from unclaimed bodies, particularly during crises such as the Coronavirus pandemic when digital resources were limited. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Factors such as lack of awareness of provenance, the law in South Africa and using anonymity for consent, influence the ethical behaviour of southern African anatomists. Clear guiding principles would be of value for anatomists globally with respect to consent to the taking and distribution of images, and transparency on the source of the digital images provided in digital texts and online platforms.

Nevertheless, prior research has demonstrated a dearth of medical law knowledge. Our study explored physicians' awareness of legal provisions concerning informed consent and confidentiality, which are essential components of the physician-patient relationship of trust. METHODS: A cross-sectional study assessed attending physicians' legal knowledge of informed consent and confidentiality regulations. The study was conducted in nine hospitals in Dolj County, Romania. Physicians were given a questionnaire with ten scenarios and instructed to select the response that best reflected their practice. We assessed the responses of physicians who claimed their practice to be entirely legal. Their legal knowledge was evaluated by comparing their answers to applicable laws. We also calculated a score for the physicians who admitted to committing a legal breach. RESULTS: Of the 305 respondents, 275 declared they never committed any law violation. However, their median correct answer score was 5.35 ± 1.66 out of 10. The specialty was the strongest predictor of legal knowledge, with emergency physicians rating the lowest and non-surgical physicians scoring the highest. Physicians who worked in both private and public sectors were better knowledgeable about legal issues than those who worked exclusively in the public sector. Results indicate that physicians are aware of the patient's right to informed consent but lack comprehensive understanding. While most physicians correctly answered simple questions, only a tiny minority identified the correct solution when confronted with ethical dilemmas. The physicians who acknowledged breaching the law, on the other hand, had a slightly higher knowledge score at 5.45 ± 2.18. CONCLUSION: Legal compliance remains relatively low due to insufficient legal awareness. Physicians display limited awareness of legal requirements governing patient autonomy, confidentiality, and access to health data. Law should be taught in all medical schools, including undergraduate programs, to increase physicians' legal knowledge and compliance."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12910-022-00835-3,Confidentiality",Cross-Sectional Studies,Humans,*Informed Consent,Knowledge,"*Physicians,36114493,PMC9479386",,,"User-Computer Interface"",30419934,PMC6233504"

Thus, the long-term success of biodiversity conservation depends on a thorough understanding of human-nature interactions. Such interactions are ubiquitous but vary greatly in time and space and are difficult to monitor efficiently at large spatial scales. However, the Information Age also provides new opportunities to better understand human-nature interactions because many aspects of daily life are recorded in a variety of digital formats. The emerging field of conservation culturomics aims to take advantage of digital data sources and methods to study human-nature interactions and thus to provide new tools for studying conservation at relevant temporal and spatial scales. Nevertheless, technical challenges associated with the identification, access, and analysis of relevant data hamper the wider adoption of culturomics methods. To help overcome these barriers, we propose a conservation culturomics research framework that addresses data acquisition, analysis, and inherent biases. The main sources of culturomic data include web pages, social media, and other digital platforms from which metrics of content and engagement can be obtained. Obtaining raw data from these platforms is usually desirable but requires careful consideration of how to access, store, and prepare the data for analysis. Methods for data analysis include network approaches to explore connections between topics, time-series analysis for temporal data, and spatial modeling to highlight spatial patterns. Outstanding challenges associated with culturomics research include issues of interdisciplinarity, ethics, data biases, and validation. The practical guidance we offer will help conservation researchers and practitioners identify and obtain the necessary data and carry out appropriate analyses for their specific questions, thus facilitating the wider adoption of culturomics approaches for conservation applications."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1111/cobi.13706,*Biodiversity",*Conservation of Natural Resources,Humans,"Information Storage and Retrieval,33749027,",,,,,

However, the potential for implementing innovative treatment options in the Austrian public and private health system is not known yet. Thus, we analyzed the readiness to use telemonitoring in diabetes care among Austrian practitioners. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among a purposive sample of Austrian practitioners (n = 41) using an adapted German version of the practitioner telehealth readiness assessment tool. We assessed three readiness domains for telemonitoring in the context of diabetes care, i.e. core readiness, engagement readiness, and structural readiness, and validated the German tool using principal components analysis. RESULTS: Study subjects perceived themselves as open to innovations and also expressed optimistic attitudes towards telemonitoring in general and offering telemonitoring-based services for their patients. Participants achieved a medium average readiness level for telemonitoring (58.2, 95% CI 53.9-62.5) and were thus in a good position to use telemonitoring, although some arguments may adversely affected its use. The top three perceived benefits of telemonitoring were enhanced quality of treatment, better therapy adjustment, and reduced travel and waiting times for patients. The top three barriers were reduced personal communication, practitioner time expenditure and equally placed poor financial compensation as well as data security and privacy issues. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that Austrian practitioners showed a quite moderate readiness to use telemonitoring in diabetes care.

The Center is creating a public database to help researchers (primarly pharmacologists and medicinal chemists) to share and access data, results, and methods from PK-NPDI studies. In order to represent the semantics of the data and foster interoperability, we are extending the Drug-Drug Interaction and Evidence Ontology (DIDEO) to include definitions for terms used by the data repository. This is feasible due to a number of similarities between pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions and PK-NPDIs. METHODS: To achieve this, we set up an iterative domain analysis in the following steps. In Step 1 PK-NPDI domain experts produce a list of terms and definitions based on data from PK-NPDI studies, in Step 2 an ontology expert creates ontologically appropriate classes and definitions from the list along with class axioms, in Step 3 there is an iterative editing process during which the domain experts and the ontology experts review, assess, and amend class labels and definitions and in Step 4 the ontology expert implements the new classes in the DIDEO development branch. This workflow often results in different labels and definitions for the new classes in DIDEO than the domain experts initially provided"," the latter are preserved in DIDEO as separate annotations. RESULTS: Step 1 resulted in a list of 344 terms. During Step 2 we found that 9 of these terms already existed in DIDEO, and 6 existed in other OBO Foundry ontologies. These 6 were imported into DIDEO"," additional terms from multiple OBO Foundry ontologies were also imported, either to serve as superclasses for new terms in the initial list or to build axioms for these terms. At the time of writing, 7 terms have definitions ready for review (Step 2), 64 are ready for implementation (Step 3) and 112 have been pushed to DIDEO (Step 4). Step 2 also suggested that 26 terms of the original list were redundant and did not need implementation"," the domain experts agreed to remove them. Step 4 resulted in many terms being added to DIDEO that help to provide an additional layer of granularity in describing experimental conditions and results, e.g. transfected cultured cells used in metabolism studies and chemical reactions used in measuring enzyme activity. These terms also were integrated into the NaPDI repository. CONCLUSION: We found DIDEO to provide a sound foundation for semantic representation of PK-NPDI terms, and we have shown the novelty of the project in that DIDEO is the only ontology in which NPDI terms are formally defined."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13326-018-0183-z,*Biological Ontologies",Biological Products/*pharmacology,"Drug Interactions,29743102,PMC5944177",,,

METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to a target audience of health care professionals (N=450), with recruitment via MTurk. The sample primarily included male participants from the United States, with the majority aged 42 years or younger. Although a large portion of respondents were medical doctors, the sample also included nurses and other health care professionals. Data were analyzed by structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Regarding the aim of developing an instrument combining adoption and social interaction, the internal consistency was above the aspirational level (a>.70) for the instrument. Furthermore, regarding the second objective involving gaining insights into the influential constructs of the anticipated intention to use, the following results were highlighted: in testing the conceptual model, the measurement model generated a good fit and the respecified structural model also generated a good fit. The tested hypotheses confirmed that social interaction constructs could explain a higher variance of users' anticipated intention to use. Perceived social isolation and decreased attentional allocation did not have a significant effect on attitude. Furthermore, the intention to use smart glasses despite nonacceptance of smart glasses by the patient significantly influenced the anticipated intention to use. In summary, constructs that focus on social interaction could contribute to better explanation and prediction of the expected adoption of smart glasses in health care. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical findings of this study provide new insights into how the mediation perspective can increase the explained variance compared to existing knowledge about adoption. Against expectations based on previous literature and despite the social issues raised earlier, these social aspects do play important roles for health care professionals but are ultimately not decisive for the intention to use. As a result, there are fewer threats to the adoption of smart glasses from the perspective of health care professionals than might be expected based on the previous literature. Therefore, the use of smart glasses can still be considered as an innovative way of working in health care."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/49610,Humans",Male,Surveys and Questionnaires,Adult,Female,*Social Interaction,*Eyeglasses,Middle Aged,

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (OVID) (2005-March 2022), Embase (2005-March 2022) and Google Scholar (2005-August 2022), supplemented with a review of reference lists and forward citation tracking. DESIGN: Reviewers selected eligible studies and abstracted data in duplicate and independently. We appraised the quality of the included studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We summarised the results in both narrative and tabular formats. We followed the PRISMA 2020 checklist for reporting our study. RESULTS: Of a total of 16 645 retrieved citations, we included 17 eligible studies. The frequency of reporting of conflicts of interest varied between 0% and 60%, but it was mostly low. In addition, a significant proportion, ranging between 15% and 80%, of healthcare professionals using social media have financial relationships with industry. However, three studies assessed the proportion of conflicts of interest of physicians identified through Open Payment Database but not reported by the authors. It was found that 98.7-100% of these relationships with industry are not reported when communicating health-related information. Also, two studies showed that there is evidence of a potential association between COI and the content of posting. No data was found on the reporting of funding sources of studies cited in health messages on social media. CONCLUSIONS: While a significant proportion of healthcare professionals using social media have financial relationships with industry, lack of reporting on COI and undisclosed COI are common.

The objective was to describe the initial development and evaluation of SPARK from the perspective of children. IMPLEMENTATION: Development and evaluation occurred in three phases: (1) low fidelity focused on functionality, (2) design focused on """"look and feel"""" and (3) high fidelity confirmed functionality and design. Cognitive interviews were conducted with children receiving cancer treatments 8-18 years of age. Evaluation occurred after every five interviews and changes were guided by a Review Panel. Quantitative evaluation included SPARK ease of use and understandability of SPARK reports. RESULTS: The number of children included by phase were: low fidelity (n = 30), design (n = 30) and high fidelity (n = 30). Across phases, the median age was 13.2 (range 8.5 to 18.4) years. During low-fidelity and design phases, iterative refinements to SPARK improved website navigation, usability and likability from the perspective of children and established symptom report design. Among the last 10 children enrolled to high-fidelity testing, all (100%) understood how to complete symptom screening, access reports and interpret reports. Among these 10 respondents, all (100%) found SPARK easy to use and 9 (90%) found SPARK reports were easy to understand.

Further, the expansion of biobanking, from the basic collection of frozen specimens to the virtual biobanks of specimens and associated data that exist today, has given a revolutionary potential on healthcare systems, particularly in the field of neurological diseases, due to the inaccessibility of central nervous system and the need of non-invasive investigation approaches. Informed Consent (IC) is considered mandatory in all research studies and specimen collections, and must specifically take into account the ethical respect to the individuals to whom the used biological material and data belong. METHODS: We evaluated the attitudes of patients with neurological diseases (NP) and healthy volunteers (HV) towards the donation of biological samples to a biobank for future research studies on neurological diseases, and limitations on the use of data, related to the requirements set by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The study involved a total of 1454 subjects, including 502 HVs and 952 NPs, recruited at Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS, Rome, from 2020 to 2024.

AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.

This study aimed to scope available evidence and determine current practices for ethics information retrieval in HTA. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, LISTA, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Once a list of relevant articles was determined, citation tracking was conducted via Scopus. HTA agency websites were searched for published guidance on ethics searching, and for reports which included ethical analyses. Methods sections of each report were analyzed to determine the databases, subject headings, and keywords used in search strategies. The team also reached out to information specialists for insight into current search practices. RESULTS: Findings from this study indicate that there is still little published guidance from HTA agencies, few HTAs that contain substantial ethical analysis, and even less information on the methodology for ethics information retrieval. The researchers identified twenty-five relevant HTAs. Ten of these reports did not utilize subject-specific databases outside health sciences. Eight reports published ethics searches, with significant overlap in subject headings and text words. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping study of current practice in HTA ethics information retrieval highlights findings of previous studies-while ethics analysis plays a crucial role in HTA, methods for literature searching remain relatively unclear.

This study aimed to explore the role of digital technology in coping with dementia in the lives of older adults with a migration background, and the possibilities to engage and collaborate with older adults. METHODS: This study combined a qualitative interview-based approach with citizen science principles in the design and execution of a project studying the use of Anne4Care. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Participants valued that technology should provide health benefits and fit into aspects of their daily lives. Anne4Care was considered helpful in staying independent and connecting to loved ones in their country of birth. The participants needed to learn new competencies to work with the device, and not all had the material prerequisites, such as an internet connection.

Mobile health (m-Health) is the use of mobile and wireless devices to improve health outcomes, health care services, and health research has been shown to have the capacity to improve medication adherence. Good adherence to ART is beneficial to patients and the public. This study aimed to assess the reported usability and satisfaction of m-Health among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The study included PLWHA under care at the Federal University Teaching Hospital (FUTH) Owerri who were previously enrolled in m-Health intervention programme. A total of 50 participants were purposefully selected for this study. This descriptive-qualitative study lasted for 3 months. In-depth interviews were conducted with 50 participants who had completed at least 7 weeks since enrolling in the trial. Data results were grouped into five main themes: varying usefulness of the intervention, the need for confidentiality, concerns about delivery modes, reasons for non-compliance, and barriers to attending appointments. Majority of the participants expressed satisfaction with the intervention they received, while some discontinued before the end due to reasons such as faith healing, use of herbal drugs, and fear of disclosure. The study emphasizes the need to integrate m-Health into standard care for PLWHA to enhance adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) refill schedules, medication dosage, and timing of intake. Due to the ongoing demand for more diverse and advanced technology, using mobile health to assist PLWHA in adhering to their medication is very feasible. Text messaging, phone calls, and WhatsApp audio notes have been recognized as valuable tools for promoting medication adherence and facilitating timely drug refills. The findings underscored the factors affecting patients' readiness, acceptance, and the barriers to effectively utilizing mobile health solutions for managing adherence challenges. The majority of study participants expressed satisfaction with the ease of use of this m-Health intervention. They reported that it helped them with the timely intake of their medication at the correct dosage, prompt refills, and keeping appointments with healthcare personnel. It is important to integrate m-Health into standard hospital procedures.

Various interventions have been implemented in Ghana that focus on increasing skilled maternal care. These are especially needed in rural areas. EHealth has the potential to contribute to reducing the challenges in maternal healthcare (MHC) that poor areas suffer. This paper analyzes the potential of eHealth solutions to improve maternal health in rural Ghana as well as the challenges to their implementation. The work was carried out in cooperation with the local health directorate of Kpando Municipality, one of the administrative areas in the Volta Region. METHODS: The study is focused on remote peninsulas and islands in Kpando Municipality. Data was gathered through triangulated research methods. Maternal health challenges were identified using the Three Delays Model for MHC. The three delays are delay in seeking care, delay accessing health facilities, and delay receiving adequate care. Challenges to the implementation of eHealth solutions in remote communities were analyzed using the Drury's 5C eHealth model for developing countries. The 5Cs correspond to context, community, capacity, connectivity, and content. RESULTS: The results show that financial dependence of women, a decision-making process based on previous experiences and traditional beliefs, competitiveness between facilities, organizational loopholes, lack of equipment, and geographical situations directly influence MHC outcomes. EHealth solutions, thanks to the high number of health workers with basic IT skills, have high potential to reduce MHC delays. However, poverty, cultural beliefs, organizational issues, connectivity, and lack of human resources were identified as main challenges to the implementation of eHealth solutions. CONCLUSION: In Ghana's rural areas the three delays proposed in the model affect the outcomes of MHC. These delays are influenced by socio-economic status, access to facilities, and quality of care. EHealth solutions show great potential to reduce the delays.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was administered from September 2018 to October 2018 to faculty and residents within the general surgery department at a large academic medical center and all fourth-year medical students at an affiliated university. The survey included direct statements and case-based scenarios on similar themes to triangulate responses. RESULTS: There were 114 participants in the survey-50 faculty, 26 residents, and 38 medical students. Digital device utilization was equivalent among all groups, and all participants use a smartphone. Digital devices were most frequently used during rounds and clinical conferences. Overall, digital device use was found more appropriate when seen in the case-based format rather than as a direct statement. Furthermore, use of these devices was seen as most appropriate when the provider explained its use or left the room to use the device. CONCLUSIONS: Digital devices are used by faculty and trainees at similar rates for parallel purposes, and the benefits for patient-related care are evident.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore how remote consultations impact on contracted general practitioner (GP) practices and how GPs perceive the implications of this uptake for the overall health care system. METHODS: In total, 5 focus groups were conducted with a total of 18 GPs from all 4 health regions of Norway in 2022. The material was subjected to Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis yielded six themes: (1) the design of novel effective clinical pathways: remote consultations empower GPs to tailor new effective clinical trajectories, blending modalities to address diverse needs across clinical episodes-from initial triage, through investigations to case closure"," (2) increased workday flexibility: remote consultations introduce variability into daily work, allowing GPs to adjust patient contact intensity, and leading to a less stressful work-home balance"," (3) erosion of organizational boundaries: easy remote access to GPs appears to reduce patients' tolerance for minor illness and self-care, hindering effective gatekeeping and shifting GPs' focus from proactive to more reactive work, increasing work-related stress"," (4) degradation of clinical shrewdness: confronted with an increasing amount of unsorted and trivial remote inquiries, GPs observe challenges in detecting and prioritizing serious cases"," (5) dilemmas related to responsibility, ethics, and legislation: remote consultations highlight a tension for contract GPs between legal responsibilities and ethical obligations, with implications for patients with limited health literacy", this may entail suboptimal evaluation or delayed treatment-potentially contributing to increased health care inequity," and (6) retaining clinical core values in a changing world. Overall, GPs affirm that remote consultations have come to stay and describe efforts to effectively manage the advantages and disadvantages inherent in such interactions to safeguard clinical effectiveness and organizational sustainability of primary health care. CONCLUSIONS: The widespread adoption of remote consultations in the Norwegian contract GP scheme fundamentally reshapes the dynamics of GP work and the overall health care system.

To address this, digital health technologies play a crucial role in effective healthcare delivery, requiring comprehensive evidence on their applications in managing multimorbidity. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify various types of digital health technologies, explore their mechanisms, and identify barriers and facilitators within the context of multimorbidity. METHODS: This scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Scoping Reviews guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were used to search articles. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, types of health technologies, mechanisms, outcomes, challenges, and facilitators. Results were presented using figures, tables, and texts. Thematic analysis was employed to describe mechanisms, impacts, challenges, and strategies related to digital health technologies in managing multimorbidity. RESULTS: Digital health technology encompasses smartphone apps, wearable devices, and platforms for remote healthcare (telehealth). These technologies work through care coordination, collaboration, communication, self-management, remote monitoring, health data management, and tele-referrals. Digital health technologies improved quality of care and life, cost efficiency, acceptability of care, collaboration, streamlined healthcare delivery, reduced workload, and bridging knowledge gaps. Patients' and healthcare providers' resistance and skills, lack of support (technical, financial, and infrastructure), and ethical concerns (e.g., privacy) barred digital health technologies implementation. Arranging organization, providing technical support, employing care coordination strategies, enhancing acceptability, deploying appropriate technology, considering patient needs, and adhering with ethical principles facilitate digital health technologies implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health technology holds significant promise in improving care for individuals with multimorbidity by enhancing coordination, self-management, and monitoring. Successful implementation requires addressing challenges such as patient resistance and infrastructure limitations through targeted strategies and investments. It is also essential to consider usability, privacy, and trustworthiness when adopting these tools."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-025-12548-5,Humans",*Multimorbidity,*Telemedicine,Digital Technology,Mobile Applications,"Digital Health,40089752,PMC11909923",,,

This is particularly evident in the emerging multi-modal learning paradigms, where dataset harmonization including a uniform data representation and filtering options are of paramount importance.Methods DICOM-structured reports enable the standardized linkage of arbitrary information beyond the imaging domain and can be used within Python deep learning pipelines with highdicom. Building on this, we developed an open platform for data integration with interactive filtering capabilities, thereby simplifying the process of creation of patient cohorts over several sites with consistent multi-modal data.Results In this study, we extend our prior work by showing its applicability to more and divergent data types, as well as streamlining datasets for federated training within an established consortium of eight university hospitals in Germany.

We observed that measurement, calculation and narrative practices could be assigned care-value or data-value and that the attempt to improve data collection within health facilities transferred 'data-value' into health centres with little consideration among project staff for its impact on care. We document acts of acquiescence and resistance to data-value by health workers. We also describe the rare moments when senior health workers reconciled these two forms of value, and care-value and data-value were enacted simultaneously. In contrast to many anthropological accounts, our analysis suggests that data-value and care-value are not necessarily conflicting.

While such a comprehensive set can represent temporal information in a document in a complete manner, some of the temporal relations in the comprehensive set may not be essential depending on the clinical application of interest. Moreover, as the types of evidence that should be used to identify explicit and implicit relations are different, current clinical temporal relation identification systems that target both explicit and implicit relations still show low performances for practical use. METHODS: In this paper, we propose to focus on a sub-task of conventional temporal relation identification task in order to provide insight into building practical temporal relation identification modules for clinical text. We focus on identification of direct temporal relations, a subset of temporal relations that is chosen to minimize the amount of inference required to identify the relations. A corpus on direct temporal relations between time expressions and event mentions is constructed, and an automatic system tailored for direct temporal relations is developed. RESULTS: It is shown that the direct temporal relations constitute a major category of temporal relations that contain important information needed for clinical applications. The system optimized for direct temporal relations achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art system developed with comprehensive set of both explicit and implicit relations in mind.

Participating in multi-site clinical research networks requires EHR data to be restructured and transformed into a common format and standard terminologies, and optimally linked to other data sources. The expertise and scalable solutions needed to transform data to conform to network requirements are beyond the scope of many health care organizations and there is a need for practical tools that lower the barriers of data contribution to clinical research networks. METHODS: We designed and implemented a health data transformation and loading approach, which we refer to as Dynamic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) (D-ETL), that automates part of the process through use of scalable, reusable and customizable code, while retaining manual aspects of the process that requires knowledge of complex coding syntax. This approach provides the flexibility required for the ETL of heterogeneous data, variations in semantic expertise, and transparency of transformation logic that are essential to implement ETL conventions across clinical research sharing networks. Processing workflows are directed by the ETL specifications guideline, developed by ETL designers with extensive knowledge of the structure and semantics of health data (i.e., """"health data domain experts"""") and target common data model. RESULTS: D-ETL was implemented to perform ETL operations that load data from various sources with different database schema structures into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) common data model. The results showed that ETL rule composition methods and the D-ETL engine offer a scalable solution for health data transformation via automatic query generation to harmonize source datasets. CONCLUSIONS: D-ETL supports a flexible and transparent process to transform and load health data into a target data model. This approach offers a solution that lowers technical barriers that prevent data partners from participating in research data networks, and therefore, promotes the advancement of comparative effectiveness research using secondary electronic health data."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-017-0532-3,""Biomedical Research",Comparative Effectiveness Research,Data Mining/methods/*standards,"Databases, Factual",Electronic Health Records/*standards,Humans,"Models, Theoretical"",28903729,PMC5598056",,Retrospective Studies

Low rare disease awareness among physicians is believed to be one of the reasons for these late and misdiagnoses of rare disease patients. The aim of this study was to investigate how information and education could be tailored to the needs and preferences of physicians in Belgium to increase their rare disease awareness and support them in diagnosing patients with a rare disorder. Nine exploratory interviews with Belgian rare disease experts were performed in December 2016 to help the development of a questionnaire on information needs of physicians and their consulted information sources in rare disease awareness and diagnosis. This online questionnaire was then completed by Belgian physicians (n = 295), including general practitioners (GPs), pediatricians and other specialists (i.e. neurologists, pediatric neurologists, endocrinologists and pediatric endocrinologists) during January and February 2017. RESULTS: Rare disease knowledge and awareness were the lowest among GPs and the highest among specialists. Interviewed experts indicated that physicians' academic and continuous medical education should be focused more on """"red flags"""" to increase rare disease attentiveness in daily clinical practice. GPs scored their academic education on rare diseases as insufficient but pediatricians and other specialists scored it significantly better (p < 0.001). Even though GPs declared to only need information on rare diseases when having a rare disease patient in their practice, specialists indicated to need more rare disease information in general. Most physicians confirmed that they had specific information needs regarding rare diseases. Unlike specialists, the majority of GPs were unaware of information sources such as Orphanet. CONCLUSION: In order to effectively support physicians in Belgium to diagnose rare diseases early, the academic medical education on rare diseases should be revised. Teaching methods should be focused more on casuistry and """"red flags"""". An Orphanet-like digital platform about rare disease symptoms, diagnostic tests and reference centers might be ideal to support correct and timely diagnosis."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13023-019-1075-8,""Adult",Belgium,Female,General Practitioners/statistics & numerical data,"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice",Humans,Male,Middle Aged,

METHODS: To address this question, an experimental testbed was developed in which a human participant and an agent collaboratively conduct triage on patients during a pandemic crisis. The agent uses data to support the human by providing advice and extra information about the patients. In one condition, the agent provided sound advice"," the agent in the other condition gave biased advice. The research question was whether participants neutralized bias from the biased artificial agent. RESULTS: Although it was an exploratory study, the data suggest that human participants may not be sufficiently in control to correct the agent's bias. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows how important it is to design and test for human control in concrete human-machine collaboration contexts.

The course that was the focus of this research, a 15-ECTS-credit online course in philosophy of science, ethics, and research methods, was offered online as part of 11 master's-level health programmes at a university in Norway. Collaborative learning in combination with digital teaching tools was the preferred pedagogical approach in the online course. The aim of the study was to describe, explore and discuss how the students collaborated in small groups in an online course to learn. METHODS: We performed six focus groups and 13 individual interviews from February 2018 to May 2019, conducting a qualitative case study with a content analysis of the data collected. The participants were master students in the same faculty at a university in Norway. All the included participants had fulfilled the 15 ECTS credit course.

A significant part of the discourse on ethically appropriate conditions relate to the levels of understanding and explicability needed for ensuring responsible clinical decision-making when using AI-CDSS. Empirical evidence on stakeholders' viewpoints on these issues is scarce so far. The present study complements the empirical-ethical body of research by, on the one hand, investigating the requirements for understanding and explicability in depth with regard to the rationale behind them. On the other hand, it surveys medical students at the end of their studies as stakeholders, of whom little data is available so far, but for whom AI-CDSS will be an important part of their medical practice. METHODS: Fifteen semi-structured qualitative interviews (each lasting an average of 56 min) were conducted with German medical students to investigate their perspectives and attitudes on the use of AI-CDSS. The problem-centred interviews draw on two hypothetical case vignettes of AI-CDSS employed in nephrology and surgery. Interviewees' perceptions and convictions of their own clinical role and responsibilities in dealing with AI-CDSS were elicited as well as viewpoints on explicability as well as the necessary level of understanding and competencies needed on the clinicians' side. The qualitative data were analysed according to key principles of qualitative content analysis (Kuckartz). RESULTS: In response to the central question about the necessary understanding of AI-CDSS tools and the emergence of their outputs as well as the reasons for the requirements placed on them, two types of argumentation could be differentiated inductively from the interviewees' statements: the first type, the clinician as a systemic trustee (or """"the one relying""""), highlights that there needs to be empirical evidence and adequate approval processes that guarantee minimised harm and a clinical benefit from the employment of an AI-CDSS. Based on proof of these requirements, the use of an AI-CDSS would be appropriate, as according to """"the one relying"""", clinicians should choose those measures that statistically cause the least harm. The second type, the clinician as an individual expert (or """"the one controlling""""), sets higher prerequisites that go beyond ensuring empirical evidence and adequate approval processes. These higher prerequisites relate to the clinician's necessary level of competence and understanding of how a specific AI-CDSS works and how to use it properly in order to evaluate its outputs and to mitigate potential risks for the individual patient. Both types are unified in their high esteem of evidence-based clinical practice and the need to communicate with the patient on the use of medical AI. However, the interviewees' different conceptions of the clinician's role and responsibilities cause them to have different requirements regarding the clinician's understanding and explicability of an AI-CDSS beyond the proof of benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The study results highlight two different types among (future) clinicians regarding their view of the necessary levels of understanding and competence. These findings should inform the debate on appropriate training programmes and professional standards (e.g. clinical practice guidelines) that enable the safe and effective clinical employment of AI-CDSS in various clinical fields. While current approaches search for appropriate minimum requirements of the necessary understanding and competence, the differences between (future) clinicians in terms of their information and understanding needs described here can lead to more differentiated approaches to solutions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12910-024-01109-w,""Humans",*Artificial Intelligence/ethics,"*Students, Medical/psychology",Germany,*Qualitative Research,Female,Male,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",

However, the majority of these applications lack a theoretical foundation and the involvement of people with diabetes during development. The aim of this study was to develop and test a mobile application (app) supporting diabetes self-management among people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes using design thinking. METHODS: The app was developed and tested in 2015 using a design-based research approach involving target users (individuals newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes), research scientists, healthcare professionals, designers, and app developers. The research approach comprised three major phases: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. The first phase included observations of diabetes education and 12 in-depth interviews with users regarding challenges and needs related to living with diabetes. The ideation phrase consisted of four interactive workshops with users focusing on app needs, in which ideas were developed and prioritized. Finally, 14 users tested the app over 4 weeks"," they were interviewed about usability and perceptions about the app as a support tool. RESULTS: A multifunctional app was useful for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The final app comprised five major functions: overview of diabetes activities after diagnosis, recording of health data, reflection games and goal setting, knowledge games and recording of psychological data such as sleep, fatigue, and well-being. Users found the app to be a valuable tool for support, particularly for raising their awareness about their psychological health and for informing and guiding them through the healthcare system after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The design thinking processes used in the development and implementation of the mobile health app were crucial to creating value for users.

This pre-implementation study used the Monash Learning Health System (LHS) paradigm to visualise iterative integrated assimilation of delirium prevention in routine care. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in a large metropolitan public health network in Australia. Following consultation with organisational leaders, a purposive sample of clinical/non-clinical participants with expertise in delirium care delivery was recruited. Interviews were inductively analysed using a framework approach. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) domains underpinned interview questions and guided thematic mapping and analysis of responses. RESULTS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 participants (clinical [n = 14] and non-clinical [n = 4]). Key themes included challenges in consistently integrating delirium risk identification and screening processes into clinical workflows, infrastructure-related obstacles hindering the digitisation of decision support, and the need to engage caregivers and staff in designing optimisations to enable appropriate and timely delirium prevention. CONCLUSIONS: This study generated insights into key factors influencing delirium prevention, focusing on the development and implementation of optimisations such as automated delirium risk prediction. Improving hospital information technology infrastructure, supporting workforce digital literacy and ensuring accountability in all professional groups are crucial for implementing automated delirium risk prediction models in clinical practice.

This makes it a good candidate for public-health monitoring tasks, specifically for pharmacovigilance. We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction (ADR) mentions from social media, particularly from Twitter. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging, mainly due to short and highly informal nature of text, as compared to more technical and formal medical reports. METHODS: Current methods in ADR mention extraction rely on supervised learning methods, which suffer from labeled data scarcity problem. The state-of-the-art method uses deep neural networks, specifically a class of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which is Long-Short-Term-Memory network (LSTM). Deep neural networks, due to their large number of free parameters rely heavily on large annotated corpora for learning the end task. But in the real-world, it is hard to get large labeled data, mainly due to the heavy cost associated with the manual annotation.

However, AI does not only offer advantages and promising benefits, but brings about also ethical risks and perils. In recent years, there has been growing interest in AI ethics, as reflected by a huge number of (scientific) literature dealing with the topic of AI ethics. The main objectives of this review are: (1) to provide an overview about important (upcoming) AI ethics regulations and international recommendations as well as available AI ethics tools and frameworks relevant to biomedical research, (2) to identify what AI ethics can learn from findings in ethics of traditional biomedical research - in particular looking at ethics in the domain of biobanking, and (3) to provide an overview about the main research questions in the field of AI ethics in biomedical research. METHODS: We adopted a modified thematic review approach focused on understanding AI ethics aspects relevant to biomedical research. For this review, four scientific literature databases at the cross-section of medical, technical, and ethics science literature were queried: PubMed, BMC Medical Ethics, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. In addition, a grey literature search was conducted to identify current trends in legislation and standardization. RESULTS: More than 2,500 potentially relevant publications were retrieved through the initial search and 57 documents were included in the final review. The review found many documents describing high-level principles of AI ethics, and some publications describing approaches for making AI ethics more actionable and bridging the principles-to-practice gap. Also, some ongoing regulatory and standardization initiatives related to AI ethics were identified. It was found that ethical aspects of AI implementation in biobanks are often like those in biomedical research, for example with regards to handling big data or tackling informed consent. The review revealed current 'hot' topics in AI ethics related to biomedical research. Furthermore, several published tools and methods aiming to support practical implementation of AI ethics, as well as tools and frameworks specifically addressing complete and transparent reporting of biomedical studies involving AI are described in the review results. CONCLUSIONS: The review results provide a practically useful overview of research strands as well as regulations, guidelines, and tools regarding AI ethics in biomedical research. Furthermore, the review results show the need for an ethical-mindful and balanced approach to AI in biomedical research, and specifically reveal the need for AI ethics research focused on understanding and resolving practical problems arising from the use of AI in science and society."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1055/s-0042-1742516,*Artificial Intelligence",Biological Specimen Banks,*Biomedical Research,Big Data,"Informed Consent,36463873,PMC9719772",,,,

There is still no evidence-based standard regarding the best medical emergency response to major incidents. Currently, reports on major incidents are non-standardised and variable in quality. This pilot study examines the first systematic reports from a consensus-based, freely accessible database, aiming to identify how descriptive analysis of reports submitted to this database can be used to improve the major incident response. METHODS: Majorincidentreporting.net is a website collecting reports on major incidents using a standardised template. Data from these reports were analysed to compare the emergency response to each incident. RESULTS: Data from eight reports showed that effective triage by experienced individuals and the use of volunteers for transport were notable successes of the major incident response. Inadequate resources, lack of a common triage system, confusion over command and control and failure of communication were reported failures. The following trends were identified: Fires had the slowest times for several aspects of the response and the only three countries to have a single dialling number for all three emergency services had faster response times. Helicopter Emergency Medical services (HEMS) were used for transport and treatment in rural locations and for triage and treatment in urban locations. In two incidents, a major incident was declared before the arrival of the first Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel. CONCLUSION: This study shows that we can obtain relevant data from major incidents by using systematic reporting. Though the sample size from this pilot study is not large enough to draw any specific conclusions it illustrates the potential for future analyses. Identified lessons could be used to improve the emergency medical response to major incidents."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12873-018-0153-x,""Communication","*Databases, Factual",Disaster Medicine/*organization & administration,Disaster Planning/organization & administration,Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration,Humans,Pilot Projects,Triage/organization & administration,

However, most physicians do not feel that they have sufficient knowledge to apply pharmacogenomics to patient care. Online information resources can help address this gap. We investigated physicians' pharmacogenomics information needs and information-seeking behavior, in order to guide the design of pharmacogenomics information resources that effectively meet clinical information needs. METHODS: We performed a formative, mixed-method assessment of physicians' information-seeking process in three pharmacogenomics case vignettes. Interactions of 6 physicians' with online pharmacogenomics resources were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for prominent themes. Quantitative data included information-seeking duration, page navigations, and number of searches entered. RESULTS: We found that participants searched an average of 8 min per case vignette, spent less than 30 s reviewing specific content, and rarely refined search terms. Participants' information needs included a need for clinically meaningful descriptions of test interpretations, a molecular basis for the clinical effect of drug variation, information on the logistics of carrying out a genetic test (including questions related to cost, availability, test turn-around time, insurance coverage, and accessibility of expert support).Also, participants sought alternative therapies that would not require genetic testing.

Because the MERS-CoV risk-standardized mortality rates are currently unavailable in the literature, the author concentrated on developing a method to estimate the risk-standardized mortality rates using MERS-CoV 3- and 30-day mortality measures. METHODS: MERS-CoV data in Saudi Arabia is publicly reported and made available through the Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) website. The author studied 660 MERS-CoV patients who were reported by the SMOH between December 2, 2014 and November 12, 2016. The data gathered contained basic demographic information (age, gender, and nationality), healthcare worker, source of infection, pre-existing illness, symptomatic, severity of illness, and regions in Saudi Arabia. The status and date of mortality were also reported. Cox-proportional hazard (CPH) models were applied to estimate the hazard ratios for the predictors of 3- and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 3-day, 30-day, and overall mortality were found to be 13.8%, 28.3%, and 29.8%, respectively. According to CPH, multivariate predictors of 3-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, illness severity, and hospital-acquired infections (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) =1.7", 8.8, 6.5," and 2.8, respectively). Multivariate predictors of 30-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing illness, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections (aHR =1.7", 19.2, 2.1, 3.7," and 2.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors were identified that could influence mortality outcomes at 3 days and 30 days, including age (elderly), non-healthcare workers, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections.

METHODS: The clinical data of patients with ESCC treated with Chemo-IMRT were collected and retrospectively reviewed. All CT images were independently reevaluated and restaged according to the 8th edition AJCC staging system. The overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed statistically. ROC curves of the various parameters of the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes were generated in order to identify the cutoff values correlated to patient survival using the area under curve. RESULTS: The gross tumor volume of the primary tumor (GTV-prT) and the clinical N stage (cN) were independent factors that influenced OS. The 5-year OS rate of patients with GTV-prT =28 cm(3), GTV-prT > 28 and = 56 cm(3), and GTV-prT > 56 cm(3) were 54.6, 31.1 and 18.6%, respectively. The 5-year OS rate of patients with cN0, cN1 SLNM (-), cN2 SLNM (-), cN3 SLNM (-) and SLNM () were 62.8 (P < 0.001), 34.0 (P = 0.16), 20.0 (P = 0.785), 0 (P < 0.001) and 26.9%, respectively. After restaging the SLNM as regional MLNs, the 5-year OS rates of the patients with cN0, 1, 2 and 3 were 62.8, 36.3, 23.7 and 7.8%, respectively. Various GTV-prT were combined with the cN to establish a new clinical TNM staging system: I, GTV-prT1 and cN0"," II, GTV-prT2 or 3 and cN0, GTV-prT1 and cN1"," III, GTV-prT1 and cN2, GTV-prT2 and cN1,2"," Iva, GTV-prT3 and cN1,2"," IVb, GTV-prT(any) and cN3"," IVc, T(any)N(any)M1. Subsequently, the OS differed significantly between the adjacent GTV-prT cN categories, except those of stage I vs. II. CONCLUSION: The SLNM should be dealt with as a regional rather than a distant disease in patients with ESCC when treated with CRT. The proposed nonsurgical staging system based on the GTV-prT and N appears to be a simple and accurate prognosis predictor for patients with ESCC who have undergone definitive Chemo-IMRT."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13014-019-1258-4,""Adult",Aged,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/therapy",

Unlike past work that has focused on feature engineering, we present a novel representation learning approach that is tailored to the ontology matching task. Our approach is based on embedding ontological terms in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. This embedding is derived on the basis of a novel phrase retrofitting strategy through which semantic similarity information becomes inscribed onto fields of pre-trained word vectors. The resulting framework also incorporates a novel outlier detection mechanism based on a denoising autoencoder that is shown to improve performance. RESULTS: An ontology matching system derived using the proposed framework achieved an F-score of 94% on an alignment scenario involving the Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary and the Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology (FMA) as targets. This compares favorably with the best performing systems on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative anatomy challenge. We performed additional experiments on aligning FMA to NCI Thesaurus and to SNOMED CT based on a reference alignment extracted from the UMLS Metathesaurus. Our system obtained overall F-scores of 93.2% and 89.2% for these experiments, thus achieving state-of-the-art results.

These pipelines often suffer from a number of shortcomings: they lack robustness and have many components written in multiple languages, each with a variety of resource requirements. Pipeline components must be linked together with a workflow system to achieve the processing of FASTQ files through to a VCF file of variants. Crafting these pipelines requires considerable bioinformatics and IT skills beyond the reach of many clinical laboratories. RESULTS: Here we present Canary, a single program that can be run on a laptop, which takes FASTQ files from amplicon assays through to an annotated VCF file ready for clinical analysis. Canary can be installed and run with a single command using Docker containerization or run as a single JAR file on a wide range of platforms. Although it is a single utility, Canary performs all the functions present in more complex and unwieldy pipelines. All variants identified by Canary are 3' shifted and represented in their most parsimonious form to provide a consistent nomenclature, irrespective of sequencing variation. Further, proximate in-phase variants are represented as a single HGVS 'delins' variant. This allows for correct nomenclature and consequences to be ascribed to complex multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), which are otherwise difficult to represent and interpret. Variants can also be annotated with hundreds of attributes sourced from MyVariant.info to give up to date details on pathogenicity, population statistics and in-silico predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Canary has been used at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne for the last 2 years for the processing of clinical sequencing data. By encapsulating clinical features in a single, easily installed executable, Canary makes sequencing more accessible to all pathology laboratories.

The associated ethical question is whether and how we as a nephrology community can and should encourage the collection of big data of our patients. We identify some ethical reflections on the use of big data, and their importance and relevance. Furthermore, we balance advantages and pitfalls and discuss requirements to make legitimate and ethical use of big data possible.  The collection, organization, and curation of data come upfront in the pipeline before any analyses. Great care must therefore be taken to ensure quality of the data at this stage, to avoid the 'garbage in garbage out' problem and suboptimal patient care as a consequence of such analyses.  Access to the data should be organized so that correct and efficient use of data is possible. This means that data must be stored safely, so that only those entitled to do so can access them. At the same time, those who are entitled to access the data should be able to do so in an efficient way, so as not to hinder relevant research.  Analysis of observational data is itself prone to many errors and biases. Each of these biases can finally result in provision of low-quality medical care.

General-purpose large language models (LLMs) lack domain-specific knowledge, limiting their clinical utility. This study introduces the LLM system Medical Evidence Retrieval and Data Integration for Tailored Healthcare (MEREDITH), designed to support treatment recommendations in precision oncology. Built on Google's Gemini Pro LLM, MEREDITH uses retrieval-augmented generation and chain of thought. METHODS: We evaluated MEREDITH on 10 publicly available fictional oncology cases with iterative feedback from a molecular tumor board (MTB) at a major German cancer center. Initially limited to PubMed-indexed literature (draft system), MEREDITH was enhanced to incorporate clinical studies on drug response within the specific tumor type, trial databases, drug approval status, and oncologic guidelines. The MTB provided a benchmark with manually curated treatment recommendations and assessed the clinical relevance of LLM-generated options (qualitative assessment). We measured semantic cosine similarity between LLM suggestions and clinician responses (quantitative assessment). RESULTS: MEREDITH identified a broader range of treatment options (median 4) compared with MTB experts (median 2). These options included therapies on the basis of preclinical data and combination treatments, expanding the treatment possibilities for consideration by the MTB. This broader approach was achieved by incorporating a curated medical data set that contextualized molecular targetability. Mirroring the approach MTB experts use to evaluate MTB cases improved the LLM's ability to generate relevant suggestions. This is supported by high concordance between LLM suggestions and expert recommendations (94.7% for the enhanced system) and a significant increase in semantic similarity from the draft to the enhanced system (from 0.71 to 0.76, P = .01). CONCLUSION: Expert feedback and domain-specific data augment LLM performance. Future research should investigate responsible LLM integration into real-world clinical workflows."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1200/PO-24-00478,""Humans",*Precision Medicine/methods,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",*Medical Oncology/methods,"Neoplasms/therapy/drug therapy"",39475661,",,,,

When this is done in new contexts (e.g., a new country), adaptations may be needed. Yet, we know little about how researchers approach this. This study aims to explore how researchers reason about adaptations and adherence when conducting replication studies, describe what adaptations they make and how these are reported in scientific journals. METHODS: This was an interview study conducted in 2014 with principal investigators of Swedish replication studies reporting adaptations to an intervention from another country. Studies (n = 36) were identified through a database of 139 Swedish psychosocial and psychological intervention studies. Twenty of the 21 principal investigators agreed to participate in semi-structured telephone interviews, covering 33 interventions. Manifest content analysis was used to identify types of adaptations, and qualitative content analysis was used to explore reasoning and reporting of adaptations and adherence. RESULTS: The most common adaptation was adding components and modifying the content to the target population and setting. When reasoning about adaptations and adherence, the researchers were influenced by four main factors: whether their implicit aim was to replicate or improve an intervention"," the nature of evidence outlying the intervention such as manuals, theories and core components"," the nature of the context, including approaches to cultural adaptations and constraints in delivering the intervention"," and the needs of clients and professionals. Reporting of adaptations in scientific journals involved a conflict between transparency and practical concerns such as word count. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers responsible for replicating interventions in a new country face colliding ideals when trying to protect the internal validity of the study while considering adaptations to ensure that the intervention fits into the context. Implicit assumptions about the role of replication seemed to influence how this conflict was resolved. Some emphasised direct replications as central in the knowledge accumulation process (stressing adherence). Others assumed that interventions generally need to be improved, giving room for adaptations and reflecting an incremental approach to knowledge accumulation. This has implications for design and reporting of intervention studies as well as for how findings across studies are synthesised."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-018-0496-8,""Adaptation, Psychological",Biomedical Research/methods/*standards,Cross-Cultural Comparison,Evidence-Based Practice/methods/standards,Humans,

This study evaluates the performance of different distance metrics in predicting the need for breath-hold radiotherapy in left-sided breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: Fifty left-sided breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast from a single institution were retrospectively studied. The left breast and organs at risk were contoured in accordance to guidelines and a plan with tangents was obtained using the free-breathing CT in supine position. Heart (mean heart dose (MHD), heart V25 Gy) and left anterior descending artery dosimetry were computed and compared against distance metrics under investigation (Contact Heart, 4th Arch and 5th Arch). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to determine optimal cut-points for distance metrics for dosimetric end points. Receiver operating characteristic curves and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the association between distance metrics and dosimetric endpoints. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of dosimetric end points. RESULTS: The mean MHD and heart V25 Gy were 2.3 Gy and 10.4 cm(3), respectively. With tangents, constraints for MHD (< 1.7 Gy and V25 Gy < 10 cm(3)) were unattainable in 80% and 46% of patients, respectively. Optimal RPA thresholds included: Contact Heart (73 mm), 4th Arch (7 mm) and 5th Arch (41 mm). Of these, the 4th Arch had the highest overall accuracy, sensitivity, concordance index and correlation coefficient. All metrics were statistically significant predictors for MHD = 1.7 Gy based on univariable logistic regression. Fifth Arch did not reach significance for heart V25 Gy = 10 cm(3). Fourth Arch was the only predictor to remain statistically significant after multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel """"4th Arch"""" metric as an accurate and practical tool to determine the need for breath-hold radiotherapy for left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy with standard tangents.

Such consultations may be a low-cost alternative to face-to-face visits, but there is limited evidence on their effects on overall healthcare consumption. The aim of this study was to assess the short- and intermediate-term impact of DTC telemedicine consultations on subsequent primary healthcare consumption, by comparing DTC telemedicine users to matched controls in a Swedish setting. METHODS: We constructed a database with individual-level data on healthcare consumption, for all residents of Region Stockholm in 2018, by linking national and regional registries. The study population included all individuals who had = 1 physician consultation (telemedicine or face-to-face) during the first half of 2018. DTC telemedicine users were matched 1:2 to controls who were non-users of DTC telemedicine but who had a traditional face-to-face consultation during the study period. The matching criteria were diagnosis and demographic and socioeconomic variables. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to compare the healthcare consumption of DTC telemedicine users to that of the control group. RESULTS: DTC telemedicine users increased their healthcare consumption more than controls. The effect seemed to be mostly short term (within a month), but was also present at the intermediate term (2-6 months after the initial consultation). The results were robust across age and disease groups. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that DTC telemedicine consultations increase the total number of physician consultations in primary healthcare. From a policy perspective, it is therefore important to further investigate for which diagnoses and treatments DTC telemedicine is suitable so that its use can be encouraged when it is most cost-efficient and limited when it is not. Given the fundamentally different models for reimbursement, there are reasons to review and possibly harmonise the incentive structures for DTC telemedicine and traditional primary healthcare."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s10198-023-01572-z,Humans",*Telemedicine,Delivery of Health Care,Referral and Consultation,*Physicians,"Sweden,36823408,PMC9950019",,,

To merit trust, those involved in collecting and sharing data need to demonstrate they are trustworthy. However, it is unclear what measures are most likely to demonstrate this. METHODS: We analyse the 'Your DNA, Your Say' online survey of public perspectives on genomic data sharing including responses from 36,268 individuals across 22 low-, middle- and high-income countries, gathered in 15 languages. We examine how participants perceived the relative value of measures to demonstrate the trustworthiness of those using donated DNA and/or medical information. We examine between-country variation and present a consolidated ranking of measures. RESULTS: Providing transparent information about who will benefit from data access was the most important measure to increase trust, endorsed by more than 50% of participants across 20 of 22 countries. It was followed by the option to withdraw data and transparency about who is using data and why. Variation was found for the importance of measures, notably information about sanctions for misuse of data-endorsed by 5% in India but almost 60% in Japan. A clustering analysis suggests alignment between some countries in the assessment of specific measures, such as the UK and Canada, Spain and Mexico and Portugal and Brazil.

The present work introduces OpenBiodiv-O, the ontology that serves as the basis of the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System. Our intent is to provide an ontology that fills the gaps between ontologies for biodiversity resources, such as DarwinCore-based ontologies, and semantic publishing ontologies, such as the SPAR Ontologies. We bridge this gap by providing an ontology focusing on biological taxonomy. RESULTS: OpenBiodiv-O introduces classes, properties, and axioms in the domains of scholarly biodiversity publishing and biological taxonomy and aligns them with several important domain ontologies (FaBiO, DoCO, DwC, Darwin-SW, NOMEN, ENVO). By doing so, it bridges the ontological gap across scholarly biodiversity publishing and biological taxonomy and allows for the creation of a Linked Open Dataset (LOD) of biodiversity information (a biodiversity knowledge graph) and enables the creation of the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System. A key feature of the ontology is that it is an ontology of the scientific process of biological taxonomy and not of any particular state of knowledge. This feature allows it to express a multiplicity of scientific opinions. The resulting OpenBiodiv knowledge system may gain a high level of trust in the scientific community as it does not force a scientific opinion on its users (e.g. practicing taxonomists, library researchers, etc.), but rather provides the tools for experts to encode different views as science progresses.

This framework was constructed based upon qualitative research with patients receiving genomic counseling following online receipt of potentially actionable complex disease and pharmacogenomics reports. Consultation with a transdisciplinary group of investigators, including practicing genetic counselors, was sought to ensure broad scope and applicability of these strategies for use with any large-scale genomic testing effort. We preserve the provision of pre-test education and informed consent as established in Mendelian/single-gene disease genetic counseling practice. Following receipt of genomic results, patients are afforded the opportunity to tailor the counseling agenda by selecting the specific test results they wish to discuss, specifying questions for discussion, and indicating their preference for counseling modality. The genetic counselor uses these patient preferences to set the genomic counseling session and to personalize result communication and risk reduction recommendations. Tailored visual aids and result summary reports divide areas of risk (genetic variant, family history, lifestyle) for each disease to facilitate discussion of multiple disease risks. Post-counseling, session summary reports are actively routed to both the patient and their physician team to encourage review and follow-up.

The classification of clinical imaging features from high-resolution computed tomography might become a powerful clinical tool for diagnosing pneumoconiosis in the future. METHODS: All chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) medical images presented in this work were obtained from 217 coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) patients and dust-exposed workers. We segmented regions of interest according to the diagnostic results, which were evaluated by radiologists. These regions were then classified regions into four categories. We employed an efficient deep learning model and various image augmentation techniques (DenseNet-ECA). The classification performance of the different deep learning models was assessed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and accuracy (ACC) were used to determine the optimal algorithm for classifying CWP clinical imaging features obtained from HRCT images. RESULTS: Four primary clinical imaging features in HRCT images, with a total of more than 1700 regions of interest (ROIs), were annotated, augmented, and used as a training set for tenfold cross-validation to generate the model. We selected DenseNet-Attention Net as the optimal model through assessing the performance of different classification algorithms, which yielded an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98, and all clinical imaging features were classified with an AUC greater than 0.92. For the individual classifications, the AUCs were as follows: small miliary opacities, 0.99"," nodular opacities, 1.0"," interstitial changes, 0.92"," and emphysema, 1.0. CONCLUSION: We successfully applied a data augmentation strategy to develop a deep learning model by combining DenseNet with ECA-Net. We used our novel model to automatically classify CWP clinical imaging features from 2D HRCT images. This successful application of a deep learning-data augmentation algorithm can help clinical radiologists by providing reliable diagnostic information for classification.

In the era of precision medicine and learning health systems, the translation of research findings into targeted therapies depends on the availability of big data and emerging research results. Web portals may work to promote the availability of novel research, working in tandem with traditional scientific publications and conference proceedings. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the potential use of web portals, which facilitate the sharing of health research findings among researchers, clinicians, patients, and the public. It also summarizes the potential legal, ethical, and policy implications associated with such tools for public use and in the management of patient care for complex diseases. METHODS: This study broadly adopts the methods for scoping literature reviews outlined by Arskey and O'Malley in 2005. Raised by the integration of web portals into patient care for complex diseases, we systematically searched 3 databases, PubMed, Scopus, and WestLaw Next, for sources describing web portals for sharing health research findings among clinicians, researchers, and patients and their associated legal, ethical, and policy challenges. Of the 719 candidate source citations, 22 were retained for the review. RESULTS: We found varied and inconsistent treatment of web portals for sharing health research findings among clinicians, researchers, and patients. Although the literature supports the view that portals of this kind are potentially highly promising, they remain novel and are not yet widely adopted. We also found a wide range of discussions on the legal, ethical, and policy issues related to the use of web portals to share research data. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 5 important legal and ethical challenges: privacy and confidentiality, patient health literacy, equity, training, and decision-making. We contend that each of these has meaningful implications for the increased integration of web portals into clinical care."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/26450,Bibliometrics",Big Data,*Health Literacy,Humans,"*Patient Portals,34762055,PMC8663501",,,,

Technologies aimed to support older adults (e.g., smart homes, assistive robots, wheelchairs) are increasingly applying artificial intelligence (AI), and thereby creating ethical challenges to technology development and use. The international debate on AI ethics focuses on implications to society (e.g., bias, equity) and to individuals (e.g., privacy, consent).

Particular attention must be paid to ensure that users adopt this technological innovation when outcomes can be improved by its use. The aim of this study was to identify the aspects that need to be analysed and discussed to implement an AI denoising PET/CT algorithm in clinical practice, based on the representations of Nuclear Medicine Technologists (NMT) from Western-Switzerland, highlighting the barriers and facilitators associated. METHODS: Two focus groups were organised in June and September 2023, involving ten voluntary participants recruited from all types of medical imaging departments, forming a diverse sample of NMT.

The aim of this study was to develop and assess a virtual patient model for primary healthcare and to investigate students' perceptions of learning with this interprofessional virtual patient model. METHODS: The virtual patient case described a patient with several medical conditions who had returned home after surgery. The virtual patient included text files, short videos, and links to illustrate different health professions' roles in home care. Ten interprofessional groups with 39 students assessed the virtual patient from four different study programmes: nursing, physiotherapy, medicine, and occupational therapy. The students answered a questionnaire about how they perceived the usability of the virtual patient and participated in group interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data from the semi-structured group interviews. RESULTS: The analysis of the interviews resulted in four main categories: The virtual patient model facilitated the learning process", It was beneficial to have students from different programmes in the group when working with the virtual patient," Working with the virtual patient helped the students to understand the roles and competencies of their own and other professions and All professions are needed in clinical work in order to help the patient. The students perceived that the mixture of text and multimedia made the virtual patient seem authentic and stimulated their group discussions, which they valued most. The students gave generally high points for usability in the questionnaire, but they also gave input for improvement of the program in their comments. CONCLUSIONS: The interprofessional virtual patient model facilitated interactions and discussions between students and may be a useful complement for interprofessional education in clinical contexts and might be a suitable tool in preparing students for future teamwork."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pone.0238797,""Adult",Cooperative Behavior,Female,Health Occupations/*education,Humans,Interprofessional Relations,

Biomedical text processing and mining could benefit from a similar resource. We take the first step towards the development of BioVerbNet: A VerbNet specifically aimed at describing verbs in the area of biomedicine. Because VerbNet-style classification is extremely time consuming, we start from a small manual classification of biomedical verbs and apply a state-of-the-art neural representation model, specifically developed for class-based optimization, to expand the classification with new verbs, using all the PubMed abstracts and the full articles in the PubMed Central Open Access subset as data. RESULTS: Direct evaluation of the resulting classification against BioSimVerb (verb similarity judgement data in biomedicine) shows promising results when representation learning is performed using verb class-based contexts. Human validation by linguists and biologists reveals that the automatically expanded classification is highly accurate. Including novel, valid member verbs and classes, our method can be used to facilitate cost-effective development of BioVerbNet. CONCLUSION: This work constitutes the first effort on applying a state-of-the-art architecture for neural representation learning to biomedical verb classification.

Within Canadian provinces, individuals are assigned unique personal health numbers that allow for linkage of administrative health records in that jurisdiction. It is therefore necessary to ensure that these data are of high quality, and that chart information is accurately coded to meet this end. Our objective is to explore the potential barriers that exist for high quality data coding through qualitative inquiry into the roles and responsibilities of medical chart coders. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 medical chart coders from Alberta, Canada. We used thematic analysis and open-coded each transcript to understand the process of administrative health data generation and identify barriers to its quality. RESULTS: The process of generating administrative health data is highly complex and involves a diverse workforce. As such, there are multiple points in this process that introduce challenges for high quality data. For coders, the main barriers to data quality occurred around chart documentation, variability in the interpretation of chart information, and high quota expectations.

METHODS: The study had a qualitative design, using individual interviews with OR nurses and NAs at a Norwegian hospital. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis in-line with recommendations from Braun & Clarke. RESULTS: Two themes were identified, namely (1) Impacting the work processes, and (2) Implications for patient safety. The OR nurses and NAs experienced that digitalization impacted on their work processes positively through making these smoother, but also negatively making the work processes vulnerable for disruptions, leading to a need for parallel actions. Digitalization was experienced to positively impact patient safety for example through making information more accessible. However, digital tools reduced focus on the patient, and then represented a risk to patient safety. CONCLUSION: OR nurses and NAs perceive that digitalization on one side may facilitate work processes and information flow. However, on the other side digitalization may steel focus on the patient.

While current state-of-the-art models for assessing the semantic similarity of textual statements from biomedical publications depend on the availability of laboriously curated ontologies, unsupervised neural embedding models only require large text corpora as input and do not need manual curation. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of current state-of-the-art neural sentence embedding models for semantic similarity estimation of sentences from biomedical literature. We trained different neural embedding models on 1.7 million articles from the PubMed Open Access dataset, and evaluated them based on a biomedical benchmark set containing 100 sentence pairs annotated by human experts and a smaller contradiction subset derived from the original benchmark set. RESULTS: Experimental results showed that, with a Pearson correlation of 0.819, our best unsupervised model based on the Paragraph Vector Distributed Memory algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art results achieved on the BIOSSES biomedical benchmark set. Moreover, our proposed supervised model that combines different string-based similarity metrics with a neural embedding model surpasses previous ontology-dependent supervised state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Pearson's r (r = 0.871) on the biomedical benchmark set. In contrast to the promising results for the original benchmark, we found our best models' performance on the smaller contradiction subset to be poor. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have highlighted the value of neural network-based models for semantic similarity estimation in the biomedical domain by showing that they can keep up with and even surpass previous state-of-the-art approaches for semantic similarity estimation that depend on the availability of laboriously curated ontologies, when evaluated on a biomedical benchmark set.

To allow rational genome-based decisions in diagnosis and treatment, clinicians need intuitive access to up-to-date and comprehensive variant information, encompassing, for instance, prevalence in populations and diseases, functional impact at the molecular level, associations to druggable targets, or results from clinical trials. In practice, collecting such comprehensive information on genomic variants is difficult since the underlying data is dispersed over a multitude of distributed, heterogeneous, sometimes conflicting, and quickly evolving data sources. To work efficiently, clinicians require powerful Variant Information Systems (VIS) which automatically collect and aggregate available evidences from such data sources without suppressing existing uncertainty. METHODS: We address the most important cornerstones of modeling a VIS: We take from emerging community standards regarding the necessary breadth of variant information and procedures for their clinical assessment, long standing experience in implementing biomedical databases and information systems, our own clinical record of diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients based on molecular profiles, and extensive literature review to derive a set of design principles along which we develop a relational data model for variant level data. In addition, we characterize a number of public variant data sources, and describe a data integration pipeline to integrate their data into a VIS. RESULTS: We provide a number of contributions that are fundamental to the design and implementation of a comprehensive, operational VIS. In particular, we (a) present a relational data model to accurately reflect data extracted from public databases relevant for clinical variant interpretation, (b) introduce a fault tolerant and performant integration pipeline for public variant data sources, and (c) offer recommendations regarding a number of intricate challenges encountered when integrating variant data for clincal interpretation. CONCLUSION: The analysis of requirements for representation of variant level data in an operational data model, together with the implementation-ready relational data model presented here, and the instructional description of methods to acquire comprehensive information to fill it, are an important step towards variant information systems for genomic medicine."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-018-0665-z,*Genetic Variation",*Genomics/methods,Humans,*Medical Informatics Applications,*Medical Oncology/methods,"*Precision Medicine/methods,30463544,PMC6249891",,,

Yet, the possibility of underlying shared mechanisms for diseases remains not well established, and few studies have confirmed their molecular predictions with clinical datasets. METHODS: In this work, we integrated genome-wide association study (GWAS) associating diseases and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with transcript regulatory activity from expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). This allowed novel mechanistic insights for noncoding and intergenic regions. We then analyzed pairs of SNPs across diseases to identify shared molecular effectors robust to multiple test correction (False Discovery Rate FDR(eRNA) < 0.05). We hypothesized that disease pairs found to be molecularly convergent would also be significantly overrepresented among comorbidities in clinical datasets. To assess our hypothesis, we used clinical claims datasets from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and calculated significant disease comorbidities (FDR(comorbidity) < 0.05). We finally verified if disease pairs resulting molecularly convergent were also statistically comorbid more than by chance using the Fisher's Exact Test. RESULTS: Our approach integrates: (i) 6175 SNPs associated with 238 diseases from ~ 1000 GWAS, (ii) eQTL associations from 19 tissues, and (iii) claims data for 35 million patients from HCUP. Logistic regression (controlled for age, gender, and race) identified comorbidities in HCUP, while enrichment analyses identified cis- and trans-eQTL downstream effectors of GWAS-identified variants. Among ~ 16,000 combinations of diseases, 398 disease-pairs were prioritized by both convergent eQTL-genetics (RNA overlap enrichment, FDR(eRNA) < 0.05) and clinical comorbidities (OR > 1.5, FDR(comorbidity) < 0.05). Case studies of comorbidities illustrate specific convergent noncoding regulatory elements. An intergenic architecture of disease comorbidity was unveiled due to GWAS and eQTL-derived convergent mechanisms between distinct diseases being overrepresented among observed comorbidities in clinical datasets (OR = 8.6, p-value = 6.4 × 10(- 5) FET). CONCLUSIONS: These comorbid diseases with convergent eQTL genetic mechanisms suggest clinical syndromes. While it took over a decade to confirm the genetic underpinning of the metabolic syndrome, this study is likely highlighting hundreds of new ones. Further, this knowledge may improve the clinical management of comorbidities with precision and shed light on novel approaches of drug repositioning or SNP-guided precision molecular therapy inclusive of intergenic risks."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12920-018-0428-9,""*Comorbidity",Computational Biology,Datasets as Topic,Disease/*genetics,Female,Gene Expression Regulation,*Genome-Wide Association Study,Humans,

The EU Horizon 2020 Project 'Genetics Clinic of the Future' surveyed European biobanks' perceptions of the legal and regulatory requirements for communicating individual research results to donors. The goal was to gain background knowledge for possible future guidelines, especially relating to the consent process. The Survey was implemented using a web-based Webropol tool. The questionnaire was sent at the end of 2015 to 351 European biobanks in 13 countries that are members of BBMRI-ERIC (Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium). Seventy-two biobanks responded to the survey, representing each of the 13 BBMRI Member States. Respondents were mainly individuals responsible for the governance of biobanks. The replies indicate that the majority of the respondents thought that their national legislation allowed them to contact participants to communicate results, and that research participants had the right to request their results. However, respondents' understanding of their national legislation varied even within member states. Our results indicate that legislation applied to biobanks in many countries may be scattered and difficult to interpret. In BBMRI-ERIC, there is an ongoing discussion about the need for European recommendations on sharing genomic biobank results with donors, which may pave the way for more coherent global guidelines.

The RADICAL study will evaluate Qure.ai's 'qXR' software in reducing reporting time for suspicious X-rays in NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised study consisting of a retrospective technical evaluation and prospective clinical effectiveness study alongside the assessment of acceptability via qualitative work and evaluation of cost-effectiveness via a cost utility analysis. The primary objective is to assess the clinical effectiveness of qXR to prioritise patients suspected with lung cancer on CXR for follow-up CT. Secondary objectives will look at the utility, safety, technical performance, health economics and acceptability of the intervention. The study period is 24 months, consisting of an initial 12 month data collection period and a 12 month follow-up period. All the standard care CXRs from outpatient and primary care requests will be securely transmitted to Qure.ai software 'qXR' for interpretation. Images with features of cancer will be flagged as 'Urgent Suspicion of Cancer' and be prioritised for radiologist review within the existing reporting workflow.

Despite an increased amount of routine data collected, planning and resource-allocation decisions made by health managers for managing HIV programs are often not based on data. This study investigated the use of information, and barriers to using routine data for monitoring the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs in two high HIV-prevalence districts in South Africa. METHODS: We undertook an observational study using a multi-method approach, including an inventory of facility records and reports. The performance of routine information systems management (PRISM) diagnostic 'Use of Information' tool was used to assess the PMTCT information system for evidence of data use in 57 health facilities in two districts. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants to investigate barriers to information use in decision-making. Participants were purposively selected based on their positions and experience with either producing PMTCT data and/or using data for management purposes. We computed descriptive statistics and used a general inductive approach to analyze the qualitative data. RESULTS: Despite the availability of mechanisms and processes to facilitate information-use in about two-thirds of the facilities, evidence of information-use (i.e., indication of some form of information-use in available RHIS reports) was demonstrated in 53% of the facilities. Information was inadequately used at district and facility levels to inform decisions and planning, but was selectively used for reporting and monitoring program outputs at the provincial level. The inadequate use of information stemmed from organizational issues such as the lack of a culture of information-use, lack of trust in the data, and the inability of program and facility managers to analyze, interpret and use information. CONCLUSIONS: Managers' inability to use information implied that decisions for program implementation and improving service delivery were not always based on data. This lack of data use could influence the delivery of health care services negatively. Facility and program managers should be provided with opportunities for capacity development as well as practice-based, in-service training, and be supported to use information for planning, management and decision-making."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-017-2641-1,""Attitude of Health Personnel",Clinical Decision-Making,Data Accuracy,Female,HIV Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control,Health Facilities/statistics & numerical data,Humans,"Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/*prevention & control",

While there has been influential work in developing ethical guidelines for Internet discussion forum-based research in public health, there is currently limited work focused on addressing ethical problems in Twitter-based public health research, and less still that considers these issues from users' own perspectives. In this work, we aim to investigate public attitudes towards utilizing public domain Twitter data for population-level mental health monitoring using a qualitative methodology. METHODS: The study explores user perspectives in a series of five, 2-h focus group interviews. Following a semi-structured protocol, 26 Twitter users with and without a diagnosed history of depression discussed general Twitter use, along with privacy expectations, and ethical issues in using social media for health monitoring, with a particular focus on mental health monitoring. Transcripts were then transcribed, redacted, and coded using a constant comparative approach. RESULTS: While participants expressed a wide range of opinions, there was an overall trend towards a relatively positive view of using public domain Twitter data as a resource for population level mental health monitoring, provided that results are appropriately aggregated.

METHODS: In this work we show how recent advances in machine learning can be used to set up a workflow that can aid investigators in discovering practitioners or groups of practitioners with unusual resource use in order to more efficiently combat waste and fraud. We combine three different techniques, which have not been used in the context of healthcare insurance anomaly detection: categorical embeddings to deal with high-cardinality categorical variables, state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection techniques to detect anomalies and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to explain the model output. RESULTS: The method has been evaluated on providers with a known anomalous profile and with the help of experts of the largest health insurance fund in Belgium.

We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. METHODS: We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. RESULTS: The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble.

We found that hospitalizations for respiratory issues were more common among patients exposed to relatively high levels of particulate matter and ozone and were higher overall among patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia than among patients with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Our manuscript describes a major release of FHIR PIT v1.0 and includes a technical demonstration use case and a clinical application on the use of FHIR PIT to support research on environmental exposures and health outcomes related to asthma and primary ciliary dyskinesia. For application of the tool to common data models (CDMs) other than FHIR, we offer open-source conversion tools to map from the PCORnet, i2b2, and OMOP CDMs to FHIR."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-024-02815-6,Humans",*Electronic Health Records,Biomedical Research,Asthma/epidemiology,Environmental Exposure/adverse effects,Spatio-Temporal Analysis,Software,"*Students, Medical"

Disease and phenotype ontologies are important for applications such as data mining, data integration and knowledge management to support translational science in drug discovery and understanding the genetics of disease. RESULTS: Eleven systems (out of 21 OAEI participating systems) were able to cope with at least one of the tasks in the Disease and Phenotype track. AML, FCA-Map, LogMap(Bio) and PhenoMF systems produced the top results for ontology matching in comparison to consensus alignments. The results against manually curated mappings proved to be more difficult most likely because these mapping sets comprised mostly subsumption relationships rather than equivalence. Manual assessment of unique equivalence mappings showed that AML, LogMap(Bio) and PhenoMF systems have the highest precision results. CONCLUSIONS: Four systems gave the highest performance for matching disease and phenotype ontologies. These systems coped well with the detection of equivalence matches, but struggled to detect semantic similarity. This deserves more attention in the future development of ontology matching systems. The findings of this evaluation show that such systems could help to automate equivalence matching in the workflow of curators, who maintain ontology mapping services in numerous domains such as disease and phenotype."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13326-017-0162-9,*Biological Ontologies",Consensus,*Disease,Humans,"*Phenotype,29197409,PMC5712086",,,,

GPs take a single best answer knowledge test, an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), and a Simulated Surgery (SimSurg) assessment which is a simulated GP consultation. The aim of this study was to examine the similarities between OSCEs and SimSurg to determine whether each assessment contributed something unique to GP ToCs. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used. Data were collated on 153 GPs who were required to undertake a ToC as a part of being investigated for FtP issues between February 2010 and October 2016. Using correlation analysis, we examined to what degree performance on the knowledge test, OSCE, and SimSurg related to case examiner recommendations and FtP outcomes, including the unique predictive power of these three assessments. The outcome measures were case examiner recommendations (i) not fit to practise", ii) fit to practise on a limited basis, or iii) fit to practise) as well as FtP outcomes (i) erased/removed from the register, ii) having restrictions/conditions," or iii) be in good standing). For the qualitative component, 45 GP assessors were asked to rate whether they assess the same competencies and which assessment provides better feedback about candidates. RESULTS: There was significant overlap between OSCEs and SimSurg, p < 0.001. SimSurg had additional predictive power in the presence of OSCEs and the knowledge test (p = 0.030) in distinguishing doctors from different FtP categories, while OSCEs did not (p = 0.080). Both the OSCEs (p = 0.004) and SimSurg (p < 0.001) had significant negative correlations with case examiner recommendations when accounting for the effects of the other two assessments. Inductive thematic analysis of the responses to the questionnaire showed that assessors perceived OSCEs to be better suited to target specific knowledge and skills. SimSurg was thought to produce a more global picture as the scenarios more accurately portray a patient consultation. CONCLUSION: While all three assessments are strong predictors of both case examiner recommendations and FtP outcomes, our findings suggest that the efficiency of GP ToCs can be improved by removing some of this overlapping content."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12909-017-1111-0,*Clinical Competence",Humans,Physicians/*standards,State Medicine,

This study aims to explore the experiences and perspectives of a diverse group of rheumatology stakeholders regarding the use of DiGAs for back pain management. Qualitative interviews and a focus group discussion were conducted with a wide range of stakeholders including rheumatic patients, rheumatologists, nurses and DiGA producers. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The study included 15 interviews (10 rheumatic patients, 4 rheumatologists, 1 DiGA producer) and 1 focus group with mixed participants (n = 12). Most stakeholders valued the instant access to personalized and effective back pain treatment provided by DiGAs. Patients appreciated the flexibility and ease of use of DiGAs which can be used anywhere and anytime. Concerns were raised about insufficient guidance regarding correct execution of exercises, which was seen as potentially dangerous and unsettling for patients. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) highlighted barriers, such as the lack of reimbursement, time constraints, and inadequate DiGA-specific education as barriers to prescribing DiGAs. Additionally, poor patient onboarding often led to delays, increased skepticism, and premature discontinuation of therapy. Stakeholders emphasized the challenges of current care driven by a shortage of HCPs and generally supported usage of back pain DiGAs. Various barriers and solution approaches were identified to enhance the performance, usability, and implementation of DiGAs in rheumatology."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00296-024-05726-x,Humans",*Qualitative Research,Male,*Rheumatic Diseases/therapy/complications,Female,Middle Aged,Adult,*Low Back Pain/therapy,

Currently, the increasing availability of health data is demanding data-driven approaches, bringing the opportunities to automate healthcare related tasks, providing better disease detection, more accurate prognosis, faster clinical research advance and better fit for patient management. In order to share data with as many stakeholders as possible, interoperability is the only sustainable way for letting systems to talk with one another and getting the complete image of a patient. Thus, it becomes clear that an efficient solution in the data exchange incompatibility is of extreme importance. Consequently, interoperability can develop a communication framework between non-communicable systems, which can be achieved through transforming healthcare data into ontologies. However, the multidimensionality of healthcare domain and the way that is conceptualized, results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting or overlapping parts. Thus, an effective solution to this problem is the development of methods for finding matches among the various components of ontologies in healthcare, in order to facilitate semantic interoperability. METHODS: The proposed mechanism promises healthcare interoperability through the transformation of healthcare data into the corresponding HL7 FHIR structure. In more detail, it aims at building ontologies of healthcare data, which are later stored into a triplestore. Afterwards, for each constructed ontology the syntactic and semantic similarities with the various HL7 FHIR Resources ontologies are calculated, based on their Levenshtein distance and their semantic fingerprints accordingly. Henceforth, after the aggregation of these results, the matching to the HL7 FHIR Resources takes place, translating the healthcare data into a widely adopted medical standard. RESULTS: Through the derived results it can be seen that there exist cases that an ontology has been matched to a specific HL7 FHIR Resource due to its syntactic similarity, whereas the same ontology has been matched to a different HL7 FHIR Resource due to its semantic similarity. Nevertheless, the developed mechanism performed well since its matching results had exact match with the manual ontology matching results, which are considered as a reference value of high quality and accuracy. Moreover, in order to furtherly investigate the quality of the developed mechanism, it was also evaluated through its comparison with the Alignment API, as well as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) which provide ontology alignment. In both cases, the results of all the different implementations were almost identical, proving the developed mechanism's high efficiency, whereas through the comparison with the NSGA-III algorithm, it was observed that the developed mechanism needs additional improvements, through a potential adoption of the NSGA-III technique. CONCLUSIONS: The developed mechanism creates new opportunities in conquering the field of healthcare interoperability. However, according to the mechanism's evaluation results, it is almost impossible to create syntactic or semantic patterns for understanding the nature of a healthcare dataset. Hence, additional work should be performed in evaluating the developed mechanism, and updating it with respect to the results that will derive from its comparison with similar ontology matching mechanisms and data of multiple nature."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.104002,""Algorithms",*Biological Ontologies,Delivery of Health Care/*standards,Electronic Health Records/*standards,Health Level Seven,Humans,Information Dissemination/*methods,*Semantics,

Effective Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have great potential to alleviate these challenges. However, such systems have not yet been widely adopted in real-world practice and have been found to cause workflow disruptions and usability issues. Therefore, it is critical to investigate how to design CDSS that meet the needs of prehospital providers while accounting for the unique characteristics of prehospital workflows. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 prehospital providers recruited from four Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agencies in an urban area in the northeastern U.S. The interviews focused on the decision-making challenges faced by prehospital providers, their technological needs for decision support, and key considerations for the design and implementation of a CDSS that can seamlessly integrate into prehospital care workflows. The data were analyzed using content analysis to identify common themes. RESULTS: Our qualitative study identified several challenges in prehospital decision-making, including limited access to diagnostic tools, insufficient experience with certain critical patient conditions, and a lack of cognitive support. Participants highlighted several desired features to make CDSS more effective in the dynamic, hands-busy, and cognitively demanding prehospital context, such as automatic prompts for possible patient conditions and treatment options, alerts for critical patient safety events, AI-powered medication identification, and easy retrieval of protocols using hands-free methods (e.g., voice commands). Key considerations for successful CDSS adoption included balancing the frequency and urgency of alerts to reduce alarm fatigue and workflow disruptions, facilitating real-time data collection and documentation to enable decision generation, and ensuring trust and accountability while preventing over-reliance when using CDSS. CONCLUSION: This study provides empirical insights into the challenges and user needs in prehospital decision-making and offers practical and system design implications for addressing these issues."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-024-02844-1,""Humans",*Emergency Medical Services,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",*Clinical Decision-Making,Adult,Qualitative Research,Male,Female,

Semantic evaluation of such data requires the data to be encoded with sufficient classifications or transformed into a knowledge-based database. METHODS: We present an approach that allows databases accessible via SQL (Structured Query Language) to be searched directly through semantic queries without the need for further transformations. Therefore, we developed I) an extension to SQL named Ontology-SQL (O-SQL) that allows to use semantic expressions, II) a framework that uses a standard terminology server to annotate free-text containing database tables and III) a parser that rewrites O-SQL to SQL, so that such queries can be passed to the database server. RESULTS: I) We compared several semantic queries published to date and were able to reproduce them in a reduced, highly condensed form. II) The quality of the annotation process was measured against manual annotation, and we found a sensitivity of 97.62% and a specificity of 100.00%. III) Different semantic queries were analyzed, and measured with F-scores between 0.91 and 0.98.

However, these interfaces typically reflect the ad hoc metadata specification practices of the associated repositories, leading to a lack of standardization in the collected metadata. This lack of standardization limits the ability of the source datasets to be broadly discovered, reused, and integrated with other datasets. To increase reuse, discoverability, and reproducibility of the described experiments, datasets should be appropriately annotated by using agreed-upon terms, ideally from ontologies or other controlled term sources. RESULTS: This work presents """"CEDAR OnDemand"""", a browser extension powered by the NCBO (National Center for Biomedical Ontology) BioPortal that enables users to seamlessly enter ontology-based metadata through existing web forms native to individual repositories. CEDAR OnDemand analyzes the web page contents to identify the text input fields and associate them with relevant ontologies which are recommended automatically based upon input fields' labels (using the NCBO ontology recommender) and a pre-defined list of ontologies. These field-specific ontologies are used for controlling metadata entry. CEDAR OnDemand works for any web form designed in the HTML format.

In addition to its primary use, this data could be used for a wide range of secondary purposes, including research and informing future healthcare for the data donor. These opportunities may require data to be shared with third parties. Although effective data sharing relies on public support, there are barriers which may prevent people from choosing to donate their genomic data and surprisingly few studies explore these barriers in depth. To address this need, this study aimed to qualitatively explore the Australian public's views and preferences for storing and sharing genomic data. Online focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using inductive content analysis. A total of 7 focus groups were conducted with 39 members of the Australian public ranging from 18 to 67 years of age. Participants were mostly supportive of genomic data being stored and shared for secondary purposes, recognising the potential benefits for individual health and wider medical research. However, some concerns were identified. Participants felt genomic data was particularly sensitive information, and raised the potential for discrimination, stigma, and other malicious uses of such data. Concerns for privacy and security of the data were also prevalent. Trustworthiness of data users was important when considering who genomic data should be shared with. Although participants were supportive of data being freely available to health professionals and researchers, they were opposed to insurance companies and employers accessing the data. There was greater controversy around sharing data with law enforcement and pharmaceutical companies. Participants recognised both benefits and harms to sharing with law enforcement. They were also cognizant of the dual purpose of pharmaceutical companies as both research and profit-driven organisations. Finally, participants expressed varying perspectives about sharing genomic data with family members, yet most agreed that explicit consent from the data donor should be required to share their information with relatives. This study highlighted several of the Australian public's perceived barriers and motivators for the storage and sharing of genomic data. Participants recognised both the benefits of collecting, storing and sharing such data widely but also the potential for harm from data misuse. While public acceptance of such endeavours is required to maximise the volume of data made available, the concerns around data access and security need to be addressed before this can occur. These findings also highlight the nuance and ethical complexity of decisions about who we should allow to access donated genomic data. These perspectives will be essential in helping to shape the way large-scale genomic data storage and sharing is developed and implemented in Australia, and internationally."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.ejmg.2022.104676,Humans",Australia,*Genomics,*Information Dissemination,Information Storage and Retrieval,"Drug Industry,36473622,",,,

Frailty is an important consideration when making patient treatment decisions, particularly in older adults, those with a cardiac diagnosis, or when major surgery is a consideration. Clinicians often report patient's frailty in progress notes and other documentation. Frailty is recorded in many different ways in patient records and many different validated frailty-measuring instruments are available, with little consistency across instruments. We specifically explored concepts relevant to decisions regarding cardiac interventions. We based our work on text found in a large corpus of clinical notes from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national Electronic Health Record (EHR) database. RESULTS: The full ontology has 156 concepts, with 246 terms. It includes 86 concepts we expect to find in clinical documents, with 12 qualifier values. The remaining 58 concepts represent hierarchical groups (e.g., physical function findings). Our top-level class is clinical finding, which has children clinical history finding, instrument finding, and physical examination finding, reflecting the OGMS definition of clinical finding. Instrument finding is any score found for the existing frailty instruments. Within our ontology, we used SNOMED-CT concepts where possible. Some of the 86 concepts we expect to find in clinical documents are associated with the properties like ability interpretation. The concept ability to walk can either be able, assisted or unable. Each concept-property level pairing gets a different frailty score. Each scored concept received three scores: a frailty score, a relevance to cardiac decisions score, and a likelihood of resolving after the recommended intervention score. The ontology includes the relationship between scores from ten frailty instruments and frailty as assessed using ontology concepts. It also included rules for mapping ontology elements to instrument items for three common frailty assessment instruments. Ontology elements are used in two clinical NLP systems. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology, which is a machine-interoperable description of frailty that reflects all the areas that clinicians consider when deciding which cardiac intervention will best serve the patient as well as frailty indications generally relevant to medical decisions.

RESULTS: Research demonstrates that medication effectiveness, patient and physician satisfaction, and accessibility costs are higher with telemedicine and AI methods compared to in-person approaches, particularly for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, addressing ethical issues, including patient data privacy and security, is crucial in this field. By considering these factors, the adoption of emerging AI and telemedicine applications, especially for work-related musculoskeletal disorders, is likely to increase. CONCLUSION: AI and telemedicine offer significant advantages, particularly in addressing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. However, ethical and legal issues surrounding their practice require standardized rules to ensure equitable access, quality care, sustainable costs, professional liability, patient privacy, data protection, and confidentiality. Further practical research studies are needed to address these considerations more effectively."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3233/WOR-240187,Humans",*Artificial Intelligence/ethics/trends,*Musculoskeletal Diseases,*Telemedicine/ethics/trends,*Confidentiality/ethics,Informed Consent/ethics,"Occupational Diseases/prevention & control,39093108,PMC11612935",,"Research Design"",29720371,PMC5930269"

Although pathologists generally have a positive attitude toward AI, they report a lack of knowledge and skills regarding how to use it in practice. Furthermore, it remains unclear what skills pathologists would require to use AI adequately and responsibly. However, adequate training of (future) pathologists is essential for successful AI use in pathology. In this paper, we assess which entrustable professional activities (EPAs) and associated competencies pathologists should acquire in order to use AI in their daily practice. We make use of the available academic literature, including literature in radiology, another image-based discipline, which is currently more advanced in terms of AI development and implementation. Although microscopy evaluation and reporting could be transferrable to AI in the future, most of the current pathologist EPAs and competencies will likely remain relevant when using AI techniques and interpreting and communicating results for individual patient cases. In addition, new competencies related to technology evaluation and implementation will likely be necessary, along with knowing one's own strengths and limitations in human-AI interactions. Because current EPAs do not sufficiently address the need to train pathologists in developing expertise related to technology evaluation and implementation, we propose a new EPA to enable pathology training programs to make pathologists fit for the new AI era """"using AI in diagnostic pathology practice"""" and outline its associated competencies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.modpat.2024.100657,""Humans",*Artificial Intelligence,*Pathologists/education,*Clinical Competence,Pathology/education,"Pathology, Clinical/education"",39542175,",,,

In contrast, systems developed with a cognitively-focused design strategy demonstrate how it is possible to introduce technology that supports and enhances the work strategies of those engaged in patient care. CONCLUSION: Significant problems emerge when technological support systems are developed without any serious and comprehensive attempt to understand the cognitive capabilities and skills deployed by those involved in patient care.

This study reports patients' perspectives on a decision aid for sacubitril/valsartan that explicitly addresses out-of-pocket costs. METHODS: Structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction from 2 medical centers to elicit their views on a publicly available decision aid for sacubitril/valsartan that explicitly incorporates considerations related to out-of-pocket costs. Qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Key themes identified were general enthusiasm for decision aids for medication decisions, openness on the part of patients to incorporation of cost into decision-making and the decision aid, requests for greater specificity regarding patient-specific cost, and challenges communicating evidence of benefit in a way that allows patients to make cost-benefit analyses for themselves. Patients also raised questions regarding logistical challenges of incorporating a decision aid into the normal clinical and decision-making workflow. CONCLUSIONS: Patients were receptive to the inclusion of out-of-pocket cost as relevant in a decision aid for sacubitril/valsartan. Key challenges to effective integration of cost in these decisions include developing mechanisms for acquiring reliable patient-specific cost estimates and addressing patients' difficulties (and sometimes skepticism) applying trial evidence to their own situation.

Cognitive assessments need to be performed by a neuropsychologist and are often time-consuming, hampering timely identification and adequate monitoring of cognitive decline in MS. OBJECTIVE: To develop a time-efficient, unsupervised, digital tool to screen for cognitive deficits in MS. METHODS: A digital (adjusted) version of the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS, including the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT, information processing speed), the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II, verbal memory) and the Spatial Recall Test (SPART, visuospatial memory) was developed: Multiple Screener (intellectual property of Sanofi Genzyme). Firstly, the clarity and feasibility of the tool was confirmed by 16 patients with MS (mean age 50.9 years (SD 9.4, range 37-68). Next, in 60 healthy controls (HCs, mean age 44.5 years (SD 14.0, range 18-67), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to describe how strongly the digital version resembled the paper and pencil-based assessment. Finally, 236 HCs (mean age 42.8 years (SD 12.8, range 18-69) were included to obtain norm scores for each test. RESULTS: ICCs between digital and paper and pencil-based assessment were excellent to good (SDMT (ICC 0.79, confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.87)"," CVLT-II (ICC 0.77, CI 0.64-0.85)"," SPART (ICC 0.61, CI 0.42-0.75)). For each test, a regression-based correction for the effect of age was applied on the raw scores before converting them to norm Z-scores. Additionally, the SDMT scores needed correction for education and the CVLT-II for education and sex (subgroups were created). CONCLUSIONS: Performance on an adjusted, digital version of the BICAMS correlates highly with the standard paper-and-pencil based test scores in HCs. Multiple Screener is an unsupervised, digital tool, with available norm scores, ultimately allowing for easy monitoring of cognitive decline in patients with MS."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.msard.2019.101479,""Adult",Aged,Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis/*etiology,"Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*standards",Feasibility Studies,Humans,

Treatments for incurable metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are evolving rapidly, and decision support systems (DSS) for this patient population have been developed to balance benefits and harms for decision-making. The aim of this systematic review was to inventory DSS for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library. DSS were described extensively, including their predictors, model performances (i.e., discriminative ability and calibration), levels of validation and user friendliness. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 3531 articles. In total, 67 articles were included after additional reference tracking. The 39 identified DSS aim to predict overall survival and/or progression-free survival, but give no information about toxicity or cost-effectiveness. Various predictors were incorporated, such as performance status, serum and inflammatory markers, and patient and tumor characteristics. Some DSS were developed for the entire incurable NSCLC population, whereas others were specifically for patients with brain or spinal metastases. Few DSS had been validated externally using recent clinical data, and the discrimination and calibration were often poor. CONCLUSIONS: Many DSS have been developed for incurable NSCLC patients, but DSS are still lacking that are up-to-date with a good model performance, while covering the entire treatment spectrum.

So far it has only been accessible for bioinformatics workflows after encoding into clinical terms by expert dysmorphologists. METHODS: Here, we introduce an approach driven by artificial intelligence that uses portrait photographs for the interpretation of clinical exome data. We measured the value added by computer-assisted image analysis to the diagnostic yield on a cohort consisting of 679 individuals with 105 different monogenic disorders. For each case in the cohort we compiled frontal photos, clinical features, and the disease-causing variants, and simulated multiple exomes of different ethnic backgrounds. RESULTS: The additional use of similarity scores from computer-assisted analysis of frontal photos improved the top 1 accuracy rate by more than 20-89% and the top 10 accuracy rate by more than 5-99% for the disease-causing gene. CONCLUSION: Image analysis by deep-learning algorithms can be used to quantify the phenotypic similarity (PP4 criterion of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines) and to advance the performance of bioinformatics pipelines for exome analysis."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41436-019-0566-2,""Algorithms",Computational Biology/*methods,"Databases, Genetic",Deep Learning,Exome/genetics,Female,Genomics,Humans,

The high potential of human-to-human transmission led to subsequent COVID-19 global pandemic. Public health strategies including reduced social contact and lockdown have been adopted in many countries. Nonetheless, social distancing and isolation could also represent risk factors for mental disorders, resulting in loneliness, reduced social support and under-detection of mental health needs. Along with this, social distancing determines a relevant obstacle for direct access to psychiatric care services. The pandemic generates the urgent need for integrating technology into innovative models of mental healthcare. AIMS: In this paper, we discuss the potential role of telepsychiatry (TP) and other cutting-edge technologies in the management of mental health assistance. We narratively review the literature to examine the advantages and risks related to the extensive application of these new therapeutic settings, along with the possible limitations and ethical concerns. RESULTS: Telemental health services may be particularly feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members and healthcare providers during this COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of TP with other technological innovations (eg, mobile apps, virtual reality, big data and artificial intelligence (AI)) opens up interesting future perspectives for the improvement of mental health assistance. CONCLUSION: Telepsychiatry is a promising and growing way to deliver mental health services but is still underused. The COVID-19 pandemic may serve as an opportunity to introduce and promote, among numerous mental health professionals, the knowledge of the possibilities offered by the digital era."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1111/ijcp.13716,Artificial Intelligence",COVID-19/*psychology,Delivery of Health Care/methods,Family/psychology,Health Personnel/psychology,Humans,Mental Disorders/*therapy/virology,Mental Health Services/ethics,

Researchrs use BLAST for processing these sequences. However traditional software parallelization techniques (threads, message passing interface) applied in newer versios of BLAST are not adequate for processing these sequences in timely manner. METHODS: A new method for array job parallelization has been developed which offers O(T) theoretical speed-up in comparison to multi-threading and MPI techniques. Here T is the number of array job tasks. (The number of CPUs that will be used to complete the job equals the product of T multiplied by the number of CPUs used by a single task.) The approach is based on segmentation of both input datasets to the BLAST process, combining partial solutions published earlier (Dhanker and Gupta, Int J Comput Sci Inf Technol_5:4818-4820, 2014), (Grant et al., Bioinformatics_18:765-766, 2002), (Mathog, Bioinformatics_19:1865-1866, 2003). It is accordingly referred to as a """"dual segmentation"""" method. In order to implement the new method, the BLAST source code was modified to allow the researcher to pass to the program the number of records (effective number of sequences) in the original database. The team also developed methods to manage and consolidate the large number of partial results that get produced. Dual segmentation allows for massive parallelization, which lifts the scaling ceiling in exciting ways. RESULTS: BLAST jobs that hitherto failed or slogged inefficiently to completion now finish with speeds that characteristically reduce wallclock time from 27 days on 40 CPUs to a single day using 4104 tasks, each task utilizing eight CPUs and taking less than 7 minutes to complete. CONCLUSIONS: The massive increase in the number of tasks when running an analysis job with dual segmentation reduces the size, scope and execution time of each task. Besides significant speed of completion, additional benefits include fine-grained checkpointing and increased flexibility of job submission. """"Trickling in"""" a swarm of individual small tasks tempers competition for CPU time in the shared HPC environment, and jobs submitted during quiet periods can complete in extraordinarily short time frames. The smaller task size also allows the use of older and less powerful hardware. The CDRH workhorse cluster was commissioned in 2010, yet its eight-core CPUs with only 24GB RAM work well in 2017 for these dual segmentation jobs. Finally, these techniques are excitingly friendly to budget conscious scientific research organizations where probabilistic algorithms such as BLAST might discourage attempts at greater certainty because single runs represent a major resource drain. If a job that used to take 24 days can now be completed in less than an hour or on a space available basis (which is the case at CDRH), repeated runs for more exhaustive analyses can be usefully contemplated."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-017-1902-7,""*Algorithms",Computational Biology/*methods,"Databases, Nucleic Acid",Humans,Search Engine,"Software"",29297287,PMC5751788",,,*Resuscitation Orders

METHODS: We performed an inductive qualitative content analysis of scientific publications that were included in a scoping review of patient-driven innovations, previously published by our research group. The review was limited to English language publications in peer-reviewed journals, published in the years 2008-2020. RESULTS: In total, 83 publications covering 21 patient-driven innovations were included in the analysis. Most of the innovations were developed for use on an individual or community level without healthcare involvement. We created three categories of unmet needs that were addressed by these innovations: access to self-care support tools, open sharing of information and knowledge, and patient agency in self-care and healthcare decisions. Eighteen (22%) publications reported outcomes of patient-driven innovations. We created two categories of outcomes: impact on self-care, and impact on peer interaction and healthcare collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: The patient-driven innovations illustrated a diversity of innovative approaches to facilitate patients' and informal caregivers' daily lives, interactions with peers and collaborations with healthcare. As our findings indicate, patients and informal caregivers are central stakeholders in driving healthcare development and research forward to meet the needs that matter to patients and informal caregivers. However, only few studies reported on outcomes of patient-driven innovations. To support wider implementation, more evaluation studies are needed, as well as research into regulatory approval processes, dissemination and governance of patient-driven innovations."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-071363,Humans",*Periodicals as Topic,Caregivers,Delivery of Health Care,Patients,"Self Care,37263703,PMC10255190",,,

However, the task of modelling clinical data, which consist of multiple heterogeneous time series of different lengths, measured at different time intervals, is a complex one. A growing body of research has applied temporal pattern mining to this problem to identify common patterns in clinical attributes over time. However, the vast majority of these algorithms use techniques that are not ideally suited to clinical data. We present an efficient and scalable framework designed specifically for temporal pattern mining of real-world clinical data. Our framework combines temporal abstraction, an extended version of the efficient pattern-growth algorithm, TPMiner, the concepts of relative risk and the odds ratio to identify interesting and high-risk patterns and multiprocessing to improve computational efficiency. A complete set of cut-off values for discretisation and interpretation of the data is provided and is applicable to studies on ageing populations in general. We name this framework Clinical Temporal Pattern Mining or C-TPM. RESULTS: The framework is applied to data from two real-world studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The patterns discovered were predictive of AD in survival analysis models with a Concordance index of up to 0.87 and contain clinically relevant variables. A visualisation module provides a clear picture of the discovered patterns for ease of interpretability. CONCLUSIONS: The framework provides an effective and scalable method of modelling multivariate, longitudinal clinical data and can identify patterns in uncommon diseases and those that progress slowly over time. It is generalisable to clinical data from other medical domains as well as non-clinical data."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-024-06018-8,*Alzheimer Disease",Humans,*Data Mining/methods,Risk Factors,*Algorithms,"Longitudinal Studies,39962385,PMC11834509",,,

Until now, no tool was available to monitor implementation of these guidelines. This study developed and assessed the content validity and usability of an online tool (the 'Canteen Scan') that provides insight into and directions for improvement of healthier food products in canteens. METHODS: The Canteen Scan was developed using a three-step iterative process. First, preliminary measures and items to evaluate adherence to the guidelines were developed based on literature, and on discussions and pre-tests with end-users and experts from science, policy and practice. Second, content validity of a paper version of the Canteen Scan was assessed among five end-users. Third, the online Canteen Scan was pilot tested among end-users representing school canteens. Usability was measured by comprehensibility, user-friendliness, feasibility, time investment, and satisfaction. RESULTS: The content validity of the Canteen Scan was ensured by reaching agreement between stakeholders representing science, policy and practice. The scan consists of five elements: 1) basic conditions (e.g. encouragement to drink water and availability of policy regarding the guidelines), 2) product availability offered on displays (counter, shelf) and 3) in vending machines, 4) product accessibility (e.g. promotion and placement of products), and 5) an overall score based on the former elements and tailored feedback for creating a healthier canteen. The scan automatically classifies products into healthier or less healthy products. Pilot tests indicated good usability of the tool, with mean scores of 4.0-4.6 (5-point Likert scale) on the concepts comprehensibility, user-friendliness and feasibility. CONCLUSION: The Canteen Scan provides insight into the extent to which canteens meet the Dutch Guidelines for Healthier Canteens. It also provides tailored feedback to support adjustments towards a healthier canteen and with the scan changes over time can be monitored.

Reporting, however, is almost always incomplete. This is due to a variety of reasons, ranging from not recognizing the diseased to failures in the technical or administrative steps leading to the final official register in the disease notification system. The reported fraction varies from 9 to 99% and is strongly associated with the disease being reported. METHODS: In this paper we propose a method to approximately estimate the full prevalence (and any other variable or parameter related to transmission intensity) of infectious diseases. The model assumes incomplete notification of incidence and allows the estimation of the non-notified number of infections and it is illustrated by the case of hepatitis C in Brazil. The method has the advantage that it can be corrected iteratively by comparing its findings with empirical results. RESULTS: The application of the model for the case of hepatitis C in Brazil resulted in a prevalence of notified cases that varied between 163,902 and 169,382 cases"," a prevalence of non-notified cases that varied between 1,433,638 and 1,446,771"," and a total prevalence of infections that varied between 1,597,540 and 1,616,153 cases. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the model proposed can be useful for estimation of the actual magnitude of endemic states of infectious diseases, particularly for those where the number of notified cases is only the tip of the iceberg.

We investigated the associations between the number of persons diagnosed with HBP at different distance corridors of noise-generating sources (churches, mosques, bus stops, and road networks), and blood pressure monitoring outlets (healthcare facilities and pharmaceutical shops) in Ibadan, Nigeria. In addition, we investigated the likelihood of being diagnosed with HBP using distance from noise-generating sources, distance to blood pressure monitoring outlets, socio-demographic and clinical status of the participants. METHODS: We investigated 13,531 adults from the African Rigorous Innovative Stroke Epidemiological Surveillance (ARISES) study in Ibadan. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), the locations of healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical shops, bus stops, churches, and mosques were buffered at 100 m intervals, and coordinates of persons diagnosed with HBP were overlaid on the buffered features. The number of persons with diagnosed HBP living at every 100 m interval was estimated. Gender, occupation, marital status, educational status, type of housing, age, and income were used as predictor variables. Analysis was conducted using Spearman rank correlation and binary logistic regression at p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was a significant inverse relationship between the number of persons diagnosed with HBP and distance from pharmaceutical shops (r=-0.818), churches (r=-0.818), mosques (r=-0.893) and major roads (r= -0.667). The odds of HBP were higher among the unemployed (AOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.11-2.24), currently married (AOR = 1.45, CI: 1.11-1.89), and previously married (1.75, CI: 1.29-2.38).

Deep learning algorithms can analyze datasets of dental images, such as panoramic radiographs to accurately identify and classify carious lesions. Using artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning methods, may help practitioners to detect and diagnose caries using radiograph images. METHODS: The panoramic radiographs of 1004 patients, who had FDPs on their teeth and met the inclusion criteria, were divided into 904 (90%) images as training dataset and 100 (10%) images as the test dataset. Following the attainment of elevated detection scores with YOLOv7, regions of interest (ROIs) containing FDPs were automatically detected and cropped by the YOLOv7 model. In the second stage, 2467 cropped images were divided into 2248 (91%) images as the training dataset and 219 (9%) images as the test dataset. Caries under the FDPs were detected using both the YOLOv7 and the improved YOLOv7 (YOLOv7  CBAM) models. The performance of the deep learning models used in the study was evaluated using recall, precision, F1, and mean average precision (mAP) scores. RESULTS: In the first stage, the YOLOv7 model achieved 0.947 recall, 0.966 precision, 0.968 mAP and 0.956 F1 scores in detecting the FDPs. In the second stage the YOLOv7 model achieved 0.791 recall, 0.837 precision, 0.800 mAP and 0.813 F1 scores in detecting the caries under the FDPs, while the YOLOv7  CBAM model achieved 0.827 recall, 0.834 precision, 0.846 mAP, and 0.830 F1 scores. CONCLUSION: The use of deep learning models to detect dental caries under FDPs by analyzing panoramic radiographs has shown promising results. The study highlights that panoramic radiographs with appropriate image features can be used in combination with a detection system supported by deep learning methods.

The study aims are to discuss the implementation of tES digital trials by performing a systematic scoping review and strategic process mapping, evaluate methodological aspects of tES digital trial designs, and provide Delphi-based recommendations for implementing digital trials using tES. METHODS: We convened 61 highly-productive specialists and contacted 8 tES companies to assess 71 issues related to tES digitalization readiness, and processes, barriers, advantages, and opportunities for implementing tES digital trials. Delphi-based recommendations (>60% agreement) were provided. RESULTS: The main strengths/opportunities of tES were: (i) non-pharmacological nature (92% of agreement), safety of these techniques (80%), affordability (88%), and potential scalability (78%). As for weaknesses/threats, we listed insufficient supervision (76%) and unclear regulatory status (69%). Many issues related to methodological biases did not reach consensus. Device appraisal showed moderate digitalization readiness, with high safety and potential for trial implementation, but low connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Panelists recognized the potential of tES for scalability, generalizability, and leverage of digital trials processes"," with no consensus about aspects regarding methodological biases.

These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed. RESULTS: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment", 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure," and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12889-017-4914-3,*Air Pollution",Data Mining/methods/*statistics & numerical data,*Epidemiologic Studies,Humans,"Machine Learning/*statistics & numerical data,29179711,PMC5704396",,

This article argues for scholars to bridge the conversations that seek to critique data science and those that seek to advance data science practice to identify and create the social and organizational arrangements necessary for a more ethical data science. We summarize four critiques that are commonly made in critical data studies: data are inherently interpretive, data are inextricable from context, data are mediated through the sociomaterial arrangements that produce them, and data serve as a medium for the negotiation and communication of values. We present qualitative research with academic data scientists, """"data for good"""" projects, and specialized cross-disciplinary engineering teams to show evidence of these critiques in the day-to-day experience of data scientists as they acknowledge and grapple with the complexities of their work. Using ethnographic vignettes from two large multiresearcher field sites, we develop a set of concepts for analyzing and advancing the practice of data science and improving critical data studies, including (1) communication is central to the data science endeavor", (2) making sense of data is a collective process," (3) data are starting, not end points, and (4) data are sets of stories. We conclude with two calls to action for researchers and practitioners in data science and critical data studies alike. First, creating opportunities for bringing social scientific and humanistic expertise into data science practice simultaneously will advance both data science and critical data studies. Second, practitioners should leverage the insights from critical data studies to build new kinds of organizational arrangements, which we argue will help advance a more ethical data science. Engaging the insights of critical data studies will improve data science. Careful attention to the practices of data science will improve scholarly critiques. Genuine collaborative conversations between these different communities will help push for more ethical, and better, ways of knowing in increasingly datum-saturated societies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1089/big.2016.0050,""*Data Interpretation, Statistical","Reproducibility of Results"",28632445,PMC5515123",,,,,

Combining these structured information sources is an important computational challenge, as large graphs are difficult to analyze visually. RESULTS: We investigate knowledge discovery in manually curated and annotated molecular interaction diagrams. To evaluate similarity of content we use: i) Euclidean distance in expert-drawn diagrams, ii) shortest path distance using the underlying network and iii) ontology-based distance. We employ clustering with these metrics used separately and in pairwise combinations. We propose a novel bi-level optimization approach together with an evolutionary algorithm for informative combination of distance metrics. We compare the enrichment of the obtained clusters between the solutions and with expert knowledge. We calculate the number of Gene and Disease Ontology terms discovered by different solutions as a measure of cluster quality. Our results show that combining distance metrics can improve clustering accuracy, based on the comparison with expert-provided clusters. Also, the performance of specific combinations of distance functions depends on the clustering depth (number of clusters). By employing bi-level optimization approach we evaluated relative importance of distance functions and we found that indeed the order by which they are combined affects clustering performance. Next, with the enrichment analysis of clustering results we found that both hierarchical and bi-level clustering schemes discovered more Gene and Disease Ontology terms than expert-provided clusters for the same knowledge repository. Moreover, bi-level clustering found more enriched terms than the best hierarchical clustering solution for three distinct distance metric combinations in three different instances of disease maps. CONCLUSIONS: In this work we examined the impact of different distance functions on clustering of a visual biomedical knowledge repository. We found that combining distance functions may be beneficial for clustering, and improve exploration of such repositories. We proposed bi-level optimization to evaluate the importance of order by which the distance functions are combined. Both combination and order of these functions affected clustering quality and knowledge recognition in the considered benchmarks. We propose that multiple dimensions can be utilized simultaneously for visual knowledge exploration."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2314-z,""*Algorithms",Cluster Analysis,Computational Biology/*methods,*Computer Graphics,Data Mining/*methods,"Databases, Factual",*Gene Regulatory Networks,"Humans"",30157777,PMC6116538",

Sustaining trust and trustworthiness is a key goal of governance, which is necessary to promote collaboration among all stakeholders and to ensure the responsible development and implementation of AI in radiology and other areas of clinical work. In this paper, the nature of AI governance in biomedicine is discussed along with its limitations. It is argued that radiologists must assume a more active role in propelling medicine into the digital age. In this respect, professional responsibilities include inquiring into the clinical and social value of AI, alleviating deficiencies in technical knowledge in order to facilitate ethical evaluation, supporting the recognition, and removal of biases, engaging the """"black box"""" obstacle, and brokering a new social contract on informational use and security.

METHODS: A library consisting of 60 liver cancer patients with IMRT planning was used to set up two models (Model-S, Model-G), using the RapidPlan knowledge-based planning system. Model-S consisted of 30 patients with special anatomical characteristics where the distance from planning target volume (PTV) to the right kidney was less than three centimeters and Model-G was configurated using all 60 patients in this library. Knowledge-based IMRT plans were created for the evaluation group formed of 13 patients similar to those included in Model-S by Model-G, Model-S and manually (M), named RPG-plans, RPS-plans and M-plans, respectively. The differences in the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were compared, not only between RP-plans and their respective M-plans, but also between RPG-plans and RPS-plans. RESULTS: For all 13 patients, RapidPlan could automatically produce clinically acceptable plans. Comparing RP-plans to M-plans, RP-plans improved V(95%) of PTV and had greater dose sparing in the right kidney. For the normal liver, RPG-plans delivered similar doses, while RPS-plans delivered a higher dose than M-plans. With respect to RapidPlan models, RPS-plans had better conformity index (CI) values and delivered lower doses to the right kidney V(20Gy) and maximizing point doses to spinal cord, while delivering higher doses to the normal liver. CONCLUSION: The study shows that RapidPlan can create high-quality plans, and our specific model can improve the CI of PTV, resulting in more sparing of OAR in IMRT for individual liver cancer patients."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13014-018-0996-z,""Humans",Liver Neoplasms/*radiotherapy,Organs at Risk/radiation effects,Radiotherapy Dosage,"Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods","Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*methods"",29587782,PMC5870074",,,

A Dynamic Time Warping-based unsupervised-clustering methodology is presented in this paper for the clustering of patient trajectories of multi-modal health data on the basis of shared temporal characteristics. Building on an earlier methodology, a new dimension of time-varying clinical and imaging features is incorporated, through an adapted cost-minimization algorithm for clustering on different, possibly overlapping, feature subsets. The model disease chosen is Huntington's disease (HD), characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. From a wide range of examined user-defined parameters, four case examples are highlighted to demonstrate the identified temporal patterns in multi-modal HD trajectories and to study how these differ due to the combined effects of feature weights and granularity threshold. For each identified cluster, polynomial fits that describe the time behavior of the assessed features are provided for an informative comparison, together with their averaged values. The proposed data-mining methodology permits the stratification of distinct time patterns of multi-modal health data in individuals that share a diagnosis, by employing user-customized criteria beyond the current clinical practice. Overall, this work bears implications for better analysis of individual variability in disease progression, opening doors to personalized preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41598-025-86686-5,*Huntington Disease/diagnosis",Humans,Cluster Analysis,*Disease Progression,Algorithms,Male,Female,Electronic Health Records,*Electronic Health Records

It impacts daily life and work capacity and is the most common reason for consulting a general practitioner (GP). According to international guidelines, information, reassurance, and advice are key components in the management of people with LBP"," however, the consultation time available in general practice for each patient is often limited. Therefore, new methods to support the delivery of information and advice are needed and online technologies provide new opportunities to extend the consultation beyond the GP's office. However, it is not known whether GPs and people consulting their GP because of LBP will accept online technologies as part of the consultation. By involving patients in the development of online information, we may produce more user-friendly content and design, and improve patient acceptance and usage, optimising satisfaction and clinical outcomes. The purpose is to study satisfaction in people consulting their GP with LBP depending on whether they are randomised to receive supporting information through a new participant-driven web application or a standard reference website containing guideline-based information on LBP. It is hypothesised that patients offered information in a new web application will be more satisfied with the online information after 12 weeks compared to patients allocated to a standard website. METHODS: Two hundred patients with LBP aged = 18 years consulting Danish general practice will be randomly allocated 1:1 to either the new web application or standard online information in permuted blocks of two, four, and six. Patients with serious spinal diseases (cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, spondyloarthritis), those without Danish reading skills or without online access, and pregnant women will not be included in the trial.

Interventions that establish healthy growth trajectories early in life promise lifelong benefits to health and wellbeing. Proactive Assessment of Obesity Risk during Infancy (ProAsk) is a novel mHealth intervention designed to enable health professionals to assess an infant's risk of future overweight and motivate parental behaviour change to prevent childhood overweight and obesity. The aim of this study was to explore parents' and health professionals' experiences of the overweight risk communication and behaviour change aspects of this mHealth intervention. METHODS: The study was conducted in four economically deprived localities in the UK. Parents (N = 66) were recruited to the ProAsk feasibility study when their infant was 6-8 weeks old. Twenty two health visitors (HVs) used a hand-held tablet device to deliver ProAsk to parents when their infants were 3 months old. Parents (N = 12) and HVs (N = 15) were interviewed when infants in the study were 6 months old. Interview data were transcribed and analysed thematically using an inductive, interpretative approach. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified across both parent and health visitor data: Engaging and empowering with digital technology", Unfamiliar technology presents challenges and opportunity, Trust in the risk score," Resistance to targeting. Most participants found the interactivity and visual presentation of information on ProAsk engaging. Health visitors who were unfamiliar with mobile technology drew support from parents who were more confident using tablet devices. There was evidence of resistance to targeting infants at greatest risk of future overweight and obesity, and both parents and health visitors drew on a number of reasons why a higher than average overweight risk score might not apply to a particular infant. CONCLUSIONS: An mHealth intervention actively engaged parents, enabling them to take ownership of the process of seeking strategies to reduce infant risk of overweight. However, cognitive and motivational biases that prevent effective overweight risk communication are barriers to targeting an intervention at those infants most at risk.

Mislabeling or inaccuracies in genome annotations can lead to incorrect scientific conclusions and hinder the reproducibility of research findings. Despite advances in genome analysis techniques, challenges persist in ensuring precise and reliable taxonomic assignments. Existing tools for genome verification often involve extensive computational resources or lengthy processing times, which can limit their accessibility and scalability for large-scale projects. There is a need for more efficient, user-friendly solutions that can handle diverse datasets and provide accurate results with minimal computational demands. This work aimed to address these challenges by introducing a novel tool that enhances taxonomic accuracy, offers a user-friendly interface, and supports large-scale analyses. RESULTS: We introduce a novel tool for the quality control and taxonomic classification tool of prokaryotic genomes, called DFAST_QC, which is available as both a command-line tool and a web service. DFAST_QC can quickly identify species based on NCBI and GTDB taxonomies by combining genome-distance calculations using MASH with ANI calculations using Skani. We evaluated DFAST_QC's performance in species identification and found it to be highly consistent with existing taxonomic standards, successfully identifying species across diverse datasets. In several cases, DFAST_QC identified potential mislabeling of species names in public databases and highlighted discrepancies in current classifications, demonstrating its capability to uncover errors and enhance taxonomic accuracy. Additionally, the tool's efficient design allows it to operate smoothly on local machines with minimal computational requirements, making it a practical choice for large-scale genome projects. CONCLUSIONS: DFAST_QC is a reliable and efficient tool for accurate taxonomic identification and genome quality control, well-suited for large-scale genomic studies. Its compatibility with limited-resource environments, combined with its user-friendly design, ensures seamless integration into existing workflows. DFAST_QC's ability to refine species assignments in public databases highlights its value as a complementary tool for maintaining and enhancing the accuracy of taxonomic data in genomic research.

Patients often spend several months in the same room, and it has been previously shown that the gut microbiomes of these infants often resemble the microbes found in the NICU. Little is known, however, about the identity, persistence, and absolute abundance of NICU room-associated bacteria over long stretches of time. Here, we couple droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), 16S rRNA gene surveys, and recently published metagenomics data from infant gut samples to infer the extent to which the NICU microbiome is shaped by its room occupants. RESULTS: Over 2832 swabs, wipes, and air samples were collected from 16 private-style NICU rooms housing very low birth weight (< 1500 g), premature (< 31 weeks' gestation) infants. For each infant, room samples were collected daily, Monday through Friday, for 1 month. The first samples from the first infant and the last samples from the last infant were collected 383 days apart. Twenty-two NICU locations spanning room surfaces, hands, electronics, sink basins, and air were collected. Results point to an incredibly simple room community where 5-10 taxa, mostly skin-associated, account for over 50% of the amplicon reads. Biomass estimates reveal four to five orders of magnitude difference between the least to the most dense microbial communities, air, and sink basins, respectively. Biomass trends from bioaerosol samples and petri dish dust collectors suggest occupancy to be a main driver of suspended biological particles within the NICU. Using a machine learning algorithm to classify the origin of room samples, we show that each room has a unique microbial fingerprint. Several important taxa driving this model were dominant gut colonizers of infants housed within each room. CONCLUSIONS: Despite regular cleaning of hospital surfaces, bacterial biomass was detectable at varying densities. A room-specific microbiome signature was detected, suggesting microbes seeding NICU surfaces are sourced from reservoirs within the room and that these reservoirs contain actively dividing cells. Collectively, the data suggests that hospitalized infants, in combination with their caregivers, shape the microbiome of NICU rooms."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40168-018-0493-5,""Aerosols",Bacteria/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification,Base Sequence,Dust,Feces/microbiology,Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*genetics,Gastrointestinal Tract/*microbiology,Humans,

This entails an increased focus on communication and information sharing across organisational borders. Technology enables efficient and effective solutions to enhance such cooperation. However, the systems in the healthcare sector tend not to communicate with one another. There is a lack of literature focusing on communication and information sharing in inter-municipal healthcare services. The aim of this article is to investigate both the characteristics of communication and information sharing, and the factors that serve as barriers to communication and information sharing for employees in inter-municipal healthcare services. METHODS: In this study, a qualitative case study approach is used to investigate both characteristics of communication and information sharing, and factors enabling barriers to communication and information sharing for employees in newly established inter-municipal healthcare services. Data collection methods were individual interviews, focus group interviews, observation studies and a workshop. A total of 18 persons participated in the study. The interviews, observations and workshop were conducted over a period of ten months. RESULTS: Communication and information sharing practices were found to be complex and characterised by multiple actors, information types and a combination of multiple actions. Findings indicate that 1. IT capability and usability 2. Differences 3. Privacy, confidentiality and security and 4. Awareness are all factors enabling barriers to communication and information sharing in inter-municipal healthcare services. Specifically, these barriers were related to lack of EHR usability, inadequate workflow processes, digital systems incompatibility, the understanding of needs in different systems and knowledge and practices regarding privacy and confidentiality. CONCLUSION: By focusing on the context of inter-municipal cooperation when assessing communication and information sharing in healthcare services, this article contributes to close a gap in existing knowledge. The perspective of the employees provides useful insight, and findings can be relevant for future theory development and for managers and policymakers in inter-municipal services."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-018-0701-z,Communication",Confidentiality,*Health Information Exchange,*Health Services,Humans,*Information Dissemination,Privacy,"Qualitative Research,30404630,PMC6223094",

The objective of this trial is to investigate a patient-centred intervention, MyLungHealth, delivered through the patient portal. The intervention is designed to improve LCS rates through increased identification of eligible patients and informed decision-making. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MyLungHealth is a multisite pragmatic trial, involving University of Utah Health and New York University Langone Health primary care clinics. The MyLungHealth intervention was developed using a user-centred design process, informed by patient and provider focus groups and interviews. The intervention's effectiveness will be evaluated through a patient-randomised trial, comparing the combined use of MyLungHealth and DecisionPrecision (a provider-focused shared decision-making intervention) against DecisionPrecision alone. The first study hypothesis is that among patients aged 50-79 with uncertain LCS eligibility (eg, 10-19 pack-years or unknown pack-years or unknown quit date for individuals who used to smoke), MyLungHealth eligibility questionnaires will result in increased identification of LCS-eligible patients (n~26 729 patients). The second study hypothesis is that among patients aged 50-79 with documented LCS eligibility (20 pack-years, quit within the last 15 years if individuals who used to smoke, and no recent screening or screening discussion), MyLungHealth education will result in increased LDCT ordering (n~4574 patients). Primary outcomes will be identification of LCS-eligible patients among individuals with uncertain LCS eligibility and LDCT ordering rates among individuals with documented LCS eligibility. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board (# 00153806). The patient data collected for this study will not be shared publicly due to the sensitive nature of the patient health information and the fact that we will not be obtaining written informed consent to allow public sharing of their data.

This approach is at the moment largely limited to prokaryotic communities and communities of few eukaryotic species with sequenced genomes. For eukaryotes the analysis is hindered mainly by a low and fragmented coverage of the reference databases to infer the community composition, but also by lack of automated workflows for the task. RESULTS: From the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project, 142 references were selected in such a way that the taxa represent the main lineages within each of the seven supergroups of eukaryotes and possess predominantly complete transcriptomes or genomes. From these references, we created an annotated microeukaryotic reference database. We developed a tool called TaxMapper for a reliably mapping of sequencing reads against this database and filtering of unreliable assignments. For filtering, a classifier was trained and tested on each of the following: sequences of taxa in the database, sequences of taxa related to those in the database, and random sequences. Additionally, TaxMapper is part of a metatranscriptomic Snakemake workflow developed to perform quality assessment, functional and taxonomic annotation and (multivariate) statistical analysis including environmental data. The workflow is provided and described in detail to empower researchers to apply it for metatranscriptome analysis of any environmental sample.

It has evolved from a task undertaken by a small team to a complex series of activities, involving several functions and qualified professionals, across multiple, interrelated, scientific disciplines, worldwide. Conceptualized as a medical specialty, concerned with the research, development, and monitoring of medicines, and spearheaded largely by pharmaceutical physicians, the discipline has extended to embrace non-medically qualified scientists progressively taking on traditional roles within the medicines development ambit. There is expanded engagement of professional backgrounds. Each individual function contributes unique expertise and skills, but they all share a sense of identity, a collective commitment, and a common goal of improving human health and well-being, through innovative treatments. At the same time, milestone advancements in the research and development environment, in healthcare delivery, the regulatory ethos, data sharing with greater transparency, the exponential digitalization, and the emphasis on patient outcomes have imposed greater accountability in systems and processes, and across all global stakeholders. Increasingly, this demands a joint purpose, fostering continuous learning, and engendering a professional identity within the medicines development community, a coinage gaining incremental affirmation as equivalent to pharmaceutical medicine. The aligned set of related competencies and capabilities across the multi-professional teams involved, the sense of identifying concurrently across different, albeit complementary, communities of practice, the obligation of ongoing specialized knowledge training, the mandated enterprise-wide codes of ethics and moral conduct, and the intertwined career paths within the larger business organizational construct of academic institutions, regulatory agencies, and the biopharmaceutical industry-all profess to meet the criteria, and merit medicines development/pharmaceutical medicine be acknowledged, regarded, and recognized as a distinct profession of stature, in its own standing.

By comparing the results of HLA genotyping from SBT and amplicon sequencing methods, ALPHLARD achieved 98.8% for WES data and 98.5% for WGS data at 2nd field resolution. We also detected three somatic point mutations and one case of loss of heterozygosity in the HLA genes from the WGS data. CONCLUSIONS: ALPHLARD showed good performance for HLA genotyping even from low-coverage data. It also has a potential to detect rare germline variants and somatic mutations in HLA genes. It would help to fill in the current gaps in HLA reference databases and unveil the immunological significance of somatic mutations identified in HLA genes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-018-5169-9,""Algorithms",Alleles,*Bayes Theorem,Computational Biology/*methods,"Databases, Genetic","*Genome, Human",Genomics/*methods,Genotype,

However, existing methods have limitations in accurately identifying cell types while maintaining model interpretability, especially in the presence of noise. METHODS: We propose a novel method called scMFG, which leverages feature grouping and group integration techniques for the integration of single-cell multi-omics data. By organizing features with similar characteristics within each omics layer through feature grouping. Furthermore, scMFG ensures a consistent feature grouping approach across different omics layers, promoting comparability of diverse data types. Additionally, scMFG incorporates a matrix factorization-based approach to enable the integrated results remain interpretable. RESULTS: We comprehensively evaluated scMFG's performance on four complex real-world datasets generated using diverse sequencing technologies, highlighting its robustness in accurately identifying cell types. Notably, scMFG exhibited superior performance in deciphering cellular heterogeneity at a finer resolution compared to existing methods when applied to simulated datasets. Furthermore, our method proved highly effective in identifying rare cell types, showcasing its robust performance and suitability for detecting low-abundance cellular populations. The interpretability of scMFG was successfully validated through its specific association of outputs with specific cell types or states observed in the neonatal mouse cerebral cortices dataset. Moreover, we demonstrated that scMFG is capable of identifying cell developmental trajectories even in datasets with batch effects.

The starting point and cornerstone of all such modeling is a genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction. The creation, further development, and application of such networks is a growing field of research thanks to a plethora of readily accessible computational tools. While the majority of studies are focused on single-species analyses, typically of a microbe, the computational study of communities of organisms is gaining attention. Similarly, reconstructions that are unified for a multi-cellular organism have gained in popularity. Consequently, the rapid generation of genome-scale metabolic reconstructed networks is crucial. While multiple web-based or stand-alone tools are available for automated network reconstruction, there is, however, currently no publicly available tool that allows the swift assembly of draft reconstructions of community metabolic networks and consolidated metabolic networks for a specified list of organisms. RESULTS: Here, we present AutoKEGGRec, an automated tool that creates first draft metabolic network reconstructions of single organisms, community reconstructions based on a list of organisms, and finally a consolidated reconstruction for a list of organisms or strains. AutoKEGGRec is developed in Matlab and works seamlessly with the COBRA Toolbox v3, and it is based on only using the KEGG database as external input. The generated first draft reconstructions are stored in SBML files and consist of all reactions for a KEGG organism ID and corresponding linked genes. This provides a comprehensive starting point for further refinement and curation using the host of COBRA toolbox functions or other preferred tools. Through the data structures created, the tool also facilitates a comparative analysis of metabolic content in any given number of organisms present in the KEGG database. CONCLUSION: AutoKEGGRec provides a first step in a metabolic network reconstruction process, filling a gap for tools creating community and consolidated metabolic networks. Based only on KEGG data as external input, the generated reconstructions consist of data with a directly traceable foundation and pedigree. With AutoKEGGRec, this kind of modeling is made accessible to a wider part of the genome-scale metabolic analysis community."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2472-z,""Computational Biology/*methods","Databases, Genetic",Genome/*genetics,Metabolic Networks and Pathways/*genetics,"Molecular Sequence Annotation"",30514205,PMC6280343",,,,Telemedicine/statistics & numerical data

Establishing this concept determines which evidence can be applied and quantified toward the final gene-disease validity, variant pathogenicity, or actionability classification. Genes with implications in more than one phenotype can necessitate a process of lumping and splitting, disease reorganization, and updates to disease nomenclature. Reappraisal of the names that are used as labels for disease entities is therefore a necessary and perpetual process. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), in collaboration with representatives from Monarch Disease Ontology (Mondo) and Online Inheritance in Man (OMIM), formed the Disease Naming Advisory Committee (DNAC) to develop guidance for groups faced with the need to establish the """"curated disease entity"""" for gene-phenotype validity and variant pathogenicity and to update disease names for clinical use when necessary. The objective of this group was to harmonize guidance for disease naming across these nosologic entities and among ClinGen curation groups in collaboration with other disease-related professional groups. Here, we present the initial guidance developed by the DNAC with representative examples provided by the ClinGen expert panels and working groups that warranted nomenclature updates.

To strengthen diagnosing and screening is the key to improve the survival and life quality of patients with EGC. This study applied data mining methods to improve screening for the risk of EGC on the basis of noninvasive factors, and displayed important influence factors for the risk of EGC. METHODS: The dataset was derived from a project of the First Hospital Affiliated Guangdong Pharmaceutical University. A series of questionnaire surveys, serological examinations and endoscopy plus pathology biopsy were conducted in 618 patients with gastric diseases. Their risk of EGC was categorized into low and high risk of EGC by the results of endoscopy plus pathology biopsy. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to solve imbalance categories of the risk of EGC. Four classification models of the risk of EGC was established, including logistic regression (LR) and three data mining algorithms. RESULTS: The three data mining models had higher accuracy than the LR model. Gain curves of the three data mining models were convexes more closer to ideal curves by contrast with that of the LR model. AUC of the three data mining models were larger than that of the LR model as well. The three data mining models predicted the risk of EGC more effectively in comparison with the LR model. Moreover, this study found 16 important influence factors for the risk of EGC, such as occupations, helicobacter pylori infection, drinking hot water and so on. CONCLUSIONS: The three data mining models have optimal predictive behaviors over the LR model, therefore can effectively evaluate the risk of EGC and assist clinicians in improving the diagnosis and screening of EGC. Sixteen important influence factors for the risk of EGC were illustrated, which may helpfully assess gastric carcinogenesis, and remind to early prevention and early detection of gastric cancer.

The aim of this research is to measure and compare the internet skills of medical school faculty and students and to investigate any potential skills gap between the two groups. METHODS: A survey of medical school faculty and students across three universities in Ireland was carried out using a validated instrument (Internet Skills Scale) measuring five internet skills (Operational, Information Navigation, Social, Creative and Mobile). Three focus groups comprising a total of fifteen students and four semi-structured interviews with faculty across three institutions were carried out to explore further findings and perceptions towards digital literacy, give further insight and add context to the findings. RESULTS: Seventy-eight medical faculty (response rate 45%) and 401 students (response rate 15%) responded to the survey. Mean scores for each internet skill were high (above 4 out of 5) for all skills apart from Creative (mean of 3.08 for students and 3.10 for faculty). There were no large differences between student and faculty scores across the five skills. Qualitative results supported survey findings with a deeper investigation into topics such as online professionalism, use of licencing and mobile application development. Needs based skills training and support were highlighted as areas for faculty development.

Most of the previous work of medical event detection treats the task as extracting concepts at word granularity, which omits the overall structural information of the clinical notes. In this work, we treat each clinical note as a sequence of short sentences and propose an end-to-end deep neural network framework. METHODS: We redefined the task as a sequence labelling task at short sentence granularity, and proposed a novel tag system correspondingly. The dataset were derived from a third-level grade-A hospital, consisting of 2000 annotated clinical notes according to our proposed tag system. The proposed end-to-end deep neural network framework consists of a feature extractor and a sequence labeller, and we explored different implementations respectively. We additionally proposed a smoothed Viterbi decoder as sequence labeller without additional parameter training, which can be a good alternative to conditional random field (CRF) when computing resources are limited. RESULTS: Our sequence labelling models were compared to four baselines which treat the task as text classification of short sentences. Experimental results showed that our approach significantly outperforms the baselines. The best result was obtained by using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) feature extractor and the sequential CRF sequence labeller, achieving an accuracy of 92.6%. Our proposed smoothed Viterbi decoder achieved a comparable accuracy of 90.07% with reduced training parameters, and brought more balanced performance across all categories, which means better generalization ability. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluated on our annotated dataset, the comparison results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for medical event detection in Chinese clinical notes of EHRs. The best feature extractor is the CNNs feature extractor, and the best sequence labeller is the sequential CRF decoder. And it was empirically verified that our proposed smoothed Viterbi decoder could bring better generalization ability while achieving comparable performance to the sequential CRF decoder."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-019-0756-5,""China",*Electronic Health Records,Humans,*Information Storage and Retrieval,Language,Narration,"Neural Networks, Computer"",30961587,PMC6454668",,

Pseudoknots are specific motifs of RNA secondary structures that are difficult to predict. Almost all existing methods are based on a single model and return one solution, often missing the real structure. An alternative approach would be to combine different models and return a (small) set of solutions, maximizing its quality and diversity in order to increase the probability that it contains the real structure. RESULTS: We propose here an original method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots, based on integer programming. We developed a generic bi-objective integer programming algorithm allowing to return optimal and sub-optimal solutions optimizing simultaneously two models. This algorithm was then applied to the combination of two known models of RNA secondary structure prediction, namely MEA and MFE. The resulting tool, called BiokoP, is compared with the other methods in the literature. The results show that the best solution (structure with the highest F(1)-score) is, in most cases, given by BiokoP. Moreover, the results of BiokoP are homogeneous, regardless of the pseudoknot type or the presence or not of pseudoknots. Indeed, the F(1)-scores are always higher than 70% for any number of solutions returned. CONCLUSION: The results obtained by BiokoP show that combining the MEA and the MFE models, as well as returning several optimal and several sub-optimal solutions, allow to improve the prediction of secondary structures. One perspective of our work is to combine better mono-criterion models, in particular to combine a model based on the comparative approach with the MEA and the MFE models. This leads to develop in the future a new multi-objective algorithm to combine more than two models.

We analysed the current landscape of data repositories to create a detailed description of available repositories and assess their suitability for hosting data from clinical studies, from the perspective of the clinical researcher. METHODS: We assessed repositories that enable storage, sharing, discoverability, re-use of the IPD and associated documents from clinical studies using a pre-defined set of 34 items and publicly available information from April to June 2018. For this purpose, we developed an indicator set to capture the maturity of the repositories' procedures and their suitability for the hosting of IPD. The indicators cover guidelines for data upload and data de-identification, data quality controls, contracts for upload and storage, flexibility of access, application of identifiers, availability of metadata, and long-term preservation. RESULTS: We analysed 25 repositories, from an initial set of 55 identified as possibly relevant. Half of the included repositories were generic, i.e. not limited to a specific disease or clinical area and 13 were launched in the last 8 years. The sample was extremely heterogeneous and included repositories developed by research funders, infrastructures, universities, and editors. All but three repositories do not apply a fee for uploading, storage or access to data. None of the repositories completely demonstrated all the items included in the indicator set, but three repositories (Dryad, Drum, EASY) met - fully or partially - all items. Flexibility of data-access modalities appears to be limited, being lacking in half of the repositories. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation, though often hampered by the lack of sufficient information, can help researchers to find a suitable repository for their datasets. Some repositories are more mature because of their support for clinical dataset preparation, contractual agreements, metadata and identifiers, different modalities of access, and long-term preservation of data.

Most studies focused on imitating dosimetrists' planning procedures to automate this process and ignored the fact that organ-based objective functions typically used in commercial treatment planning systems (such as dose-volume function) usually lead to sub-optimal plans. To guarantee the optimum results and to automate this process, we incorporate an improved automation strategy and a voxel-based optimization algorithm to generate a novel automatic multi-criteria optimization framework. We then evaluate it in clinical cases. METHODS: This novel automatic multi-criteria optimization framework incorporates a ranked priority-list based automatic constraints adjustment strategy and an in-house developed voxel-based optimization algorithm. Constraints are sequentially adjusted following a pre-defined priority list. Afterward, a voxel-based fluence map optimization (FMO) with an orientation to the newly updated constraints is launched to find a Pareto optimal solution. Loops of constraints adjustment are repeated until each of them could not be relaxed or tightened. The feasibility of the framework is evaluated with 10 automatic generated gynecology (GYN) cancer IMRT cases by comparing the dosimetric performance with the original. RESULTS: Plan quality improvement is observed for our automatic multi-criteria optimization method. Comparable DVHs are found for the planning target volume (PTV), but with better organs-at-risk (OAR) dose sparing. Among 13 evaluated dosimetric endpoints, 5 of them show significant improvements in automatically generated plans compared with the original plans. Investigation of improvement tendency during optimization exhibits gradual change as the optimization stage proceeds. An initial voxel-based optimization stage and in-low-priority dosimetric criteria tighten can significantly contribute to the optimization procedure. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed an automatic multi-criteria optimization framework that can dramatically reduce the current trial-and-error patterned planning workload while affording an efficient method to assure high plan quality consistency. This optimization framework is expected to greatly facilitate precise radiation therapy because of its advantages of planning efficiency and plan quality improvement."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13014-018-1179-7,""*Algorithms",Automation,Female,"Genital Neoplasms, Female/*radiotherapy",Humans,Radiotherapy Dosage,"Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods/*standards","Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*methods/*standards"",30518381,PMC6280392",

Even though patients with mental health problems have a strong interest in being more involved in decision making about their treatment, research has mainly focused on PDAs for somatic conditions. In this scoping review, we focus on patients suffering from depression and the role of PDAs for this patient group. The review offers an overview of digital and analog PDAs, their advantages and disadvantages as well as recommendations for further research and development. METHODS: A systematic search of the existing literature guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was conducted. Three electronic literature databases with the appropriate thematic focus were searched (PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science). The search strategy used controlled and natural language to search for the key concepts decision aids and depression. The articles were selected in a two-step process guided by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We narratively synthetized information extracted from 40 research articles. RESULTS: We included 40 articles in our review. Our review revealed that there is more focus on digital PDAs in research than in clinical practice. Digitalization can enhance the benefits of PDAs by developing tools that are more efficient, interactive, and personalized. The main disadvantages of both types of PDAs for the treatment of depression are related to time, dissemination, and capacity building for the health care providers. Digital PDAs need to be regularly updated, effective strategies for their dissemination and acceptance need to be identified, and clinicians need sufficient training on how to use digital PDAs. There is more research needed to study which forms of PDAs are most appropriate for various patient groups (e.g., older adults, or patients with comorbidities), and to identify the most effective ways of PDAs' integration in the clinical workflow. The findings from our review could be well aligned with the International Patient Decision Aids Standards. DISCUSSION: More research is needed regarding effective strategies for the implementation of digital PDAs into the clinical workflow, ethical issues raised by the digital format, and opportunities of tailoring PDAs for diverse patient groups."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fdgth.2023.1208889,"""",37744684,PMC10513051",,,,,,,,

H3ABioNet is part of the Human Health and Heredity in Africa program (H3Africa), an African-led research consortium funded by the US National Institutes of Health and the UK Wellcome Trust, aimed at using genomics to study and improve the health of Africans. A key role of H3ABioNet is to support H3Africa projects by building bioinformatics infrastructure such as portable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows for use on heterogeneous African computing environments. Processing and analysis of genomic data is an example of a big data application requiring complex interdependent data analysis workflows. Such bioinformatics workflows take the primary and secondary input data through several computationally-intensive processing steps using different software packages, where some of the outputs form inputs for other steps. Implementing scalable, reproducible, portable and easy-to-use workflows is particularly challenging. RESULTS: H3ABioNet has built four workflows to support (1) the calling of variants from high-throughput sequencing data", (2) the analysis of microbial populations from 16S rDNA sequence data, (3) genotyping and genome-wide association studies," and (4) single nucleotide polymorphism imputation. A week-long hackathon was organized in August 2016 with participants from six African bioinformatics groups, and US and European collaborators. Two of the workflows are built using the Common Workflow Language framework (CWL) and two using Nextflow. All the workflows are containerized for improved portability and reproducibility using Docker, and are publicly available for use by members of the H3Africa consortium and the international research community. CONCLUSION: The H3ABioNet workflows have been implemented in view of offering ease of use for the end user and high levels of reproducibility and portability, all while following modern state of the art bioinformatics data processing protocols. The H3ABioNet workflows will service the H3Africa consortium projects and are currently in use. All four workflows are also publicly available for research scientists worldwide to use and adapt for their respective needs. The H3ABioNet workflows will help develop bioinformatics capacity and assist genomics research within Africa and serve to increase the scientific output of H3Africa and its Pan-African Bioinformatics Network."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2446-1,Africa",Computational Biology/*methods,Genomics/*methods,Humans,"Reproducibility of Results,30486782,PMC6264621",

Mobile health (mHealth) applications offer a solution by enabling CHWs to record and submit data electronically. However, the barriers and benefits of mHealth usage among CHWs in informal urban settlements remain poorly understood. This study sought to determine the barriers and benefits of mHealth among CHWs in Banda parish, Kampala. METHODS: This qualitative study involved 12 key informant interviews (KIIs) among focal persons from Kampala City Council Authority (KCCA) and NGOs involved in data collected by CHWs, and officials from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and two mixed-sex Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) of CHWs from Banda parish, Kampala district. Data analysis utilised Atlas Ti Version 7.5.7. Thematic analysis was conducted, and themes were aligned with the social-ecological model. RESULTS: Three themes of institutional and policy, community and interpersonal, and individual aligning to the Social ecological model highlighted the factors contributing to barriers and the benefits of mHealth among CHWs for iCCM. The key barriers to usability, acceptability and sustainability included high training costs, CHW demotivation, infrastructure limitations, data security concerns, community awareness deficits, and skill deficiencies. Conversely, mHealth offers benefits such as timely data submission, enhanced data quality, geo-mapping capabilities, improved CHW performance monitoring, community health surveillance, cost-effective reporting, and CHW empowering with technology. CONCLUSION: Despite limited mHealth experience, CHWs expressed enthusiasm for its potential. Implementation was viewed as a solution to multiple challenges, facilitating access to health information, efficient data reporting, and administrative processes, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Successful mHealth implementation requires addressing CHWs' demotivation, ensuring reliable power and network connectivity, and enhancing capacity for digital data ethics and management. By overcoming these barriers, mHealth can significantly enhance healthcare delivery at the community level, leveraging technology to optimize resource utilization and improve health outcomes. mHealth holds promise for transforming CHW practices, yet its effective integration necessitates targeted interventions to address systemic challenges and ensure sustainable implementation in LMIC contexts."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12875-024-02430-4,Humans",Uganda,*Community Health Workers/education,*Telemedicine,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Male,Qualitative Research,

Chronic care management requires active collaboration and knowledge exchange between patients and health care professionals (HCPs) for best possible health outcomes, which we describe as co-care. eHealth services have the potential to support the realization of co-care between people with PD (PwP) and HCPs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore how co-care could be operationalized in PD care, supported by eHealth. More specifically, this study explores PwP's and HCPs' expectations and desired eHealth functionalities to achieve co-care. METHODS: Principles of participatory design were used to enable the identification of co-care needs and design ideas, in a series of 4 half-day co-design workshops. The sample included 7 (4 women) PwP and 9 (4 women) HCPs, including 4 neurologists, 3 nurses, and 2 physiotherapists. The co-design process resulted in a functional prototype that was evaluated by the co-design participants in the last workshop. Data were collected through note cards produced by the participants during the first 3 workshops and focus group discussions during the 3rd and 4th workshops. The data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. After the workshop series, the prototype was demonstrated at a Mini Fair for ongoing PD research and evaluated using a self-developed questionnaire with 37 respondents: 31 PwP (14 women) and 6 informal caregivers (3 women). Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: The qualitative analysis of data resulted in 2 main themes. The first theme, core eHealth functionalities and their expected values, describes 6 desired eHealth functionalities for supporting PD co-care between PwP and HCPs: (1) self-tracking, (2) previsit forms, (3) graphical visualization, (4) clinical decision support, (5) self-care recommendations, and (6) asynchronous communication. The second theme, individual and organizational constraints, describes constraints that need to be addressed to succeed with an eHealth service for co-care. Individual constraints include eHealth literacy and acceptance"," organizational constraints include teamwork and administrative workload. The majority of the questionnaire respondents (31/37, 84%) perceived that they would benefit from an eHealth service similar to the demonstrated prototype. All prototype functionalities were rated as very important or important by the majority of respondents (ranging from 86% to 97% per functionality). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to our knowledge on how PD co-care could be operationalized. Co-care implies a shift from episodic routine-driven care to more flexible care management that is driven by the mutual needs of patients and HCPs and supported by active information exchange between them, as well as automated information processing to generate patient-specific advice. More research is needed to further explore the concept of co-care in chronic care management and what it means for self-care and health care.

At the same time, the European Medicines Agency and the large federations of rare disease patient organizations (POs), such as EURORDIS, contributed to a great cultural change, by promoting a paradigm shift from product-registries to patient-centred registries. In Italy, several NMD POs and Fondazione Telethon undertook the development of a TREAT-NMD linked patient registry in 2009, with the referring clinical network providing input and support to this initiative through the years. This article describes the outcome of this joint effort and shares the experience gained. METHODS: The Italian NMD registry is based on an informatics technology platform, structured according to the most rigorous legal national and European requirements for management of patient sensitive data. A user-friendly web interface allows both direct patients and clinicians' participation. The platform's design permits expansion to incorporate new modules and new registries, and is suitable of interoperability with other international efforts. RESULTS: When the Italian NMD Registry was initiated, an ad hoc legal entity (NMD Registry Association) was devised to manage registries' data. Currently, several disease-specific databases are hosted on the platform. They collect molecular and clinical details of individuals affected by Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, transthyretin type-familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, muscle glycogen storage disorders, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy. These disease-specific registries are at different stage of development, and the NMD Registry itself has gone through several implementation steps to fulfil different technical and governance needs. The new governance model is based on the agreement between the NMD Registry Association and the professional societies representing the Italian NMD clinical network. Overall, up to now the NMD registry has collected data on more than 2000 individuals living with a NMD condition. CONCLUSIONS: The Italian NMD Registry is a flexible platform that manages several condition-specific databases and is suitable to upgrade. All stakeholders participate in its management, with clear roles and responsibilities. This governance model has been key to its success. In fact, it favored patient empowerment and their direct participation in research, while also engaging the expert clinicians of the Italian network in the collection of accurate clinical data according to the best clinical practices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13023-018-0918-z,""Databases, Factual",Humans,Italy,Neuromuscular Diseases/*epidemiology,Rare Diseases,"*Registries"",30286784,PMC6172847",,,

This variety allows bioinformaticians and bioinformatic work to contribute to much (if not most) of life science research in profound ways. The multitude of bioinformatic work also translates into a multitude of credit-distribution arrangements, apparently dismissing that work. RESULTS: We report on the epistemic and social arrangements that characterise the relationship between bioinformatics and life science. We describe, in sociological terms, the character, power and future of bioinformatic work. The character of bioinformatic work is such that its cultural, institutional and technical structures allow for it to be black-boxed easily. The result is that bioinformatic expertise and contributions travel easily and quickly, yet remain largely uncredited. The power of bioinformatic work is shaped by its dependency on life science work, which combined with the black-boxed character of bioinformatic expertise further contributes to situating bioinformatics on the periphery of the life sciences. Finally, the imagined futures of bioinformatic work suggest that bioinformatics will become ever more indispensable without necessarily becoming more visible, forcing bioinformaticians into difficult professional and career choices.

Given the lengthy rehabilitation process, a blended intervention can be used to compliment face-to-face physiotherapy with a digital exercise intervention. In this study, we used TRAK, a web-based tool that has been developed to support knee rehabilitation, which provides individually tailored exercise programs with videos, instructions and progress logs for each exercise, relevant health information and a contact option that allows a patient to email a physiotherapist for additional support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of TRAK-based blended intervention in post ACL reconstruction rehabilitation. METHODS: A qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews was used on a convenience sample of participants following an ACL reconstruction, and their treating physiotherapists, in a London NHS hospital. Participants were asked to use TRAK alongside face-to-face physiotherapy for 16 weeks. Interviews were carried out, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded by two researchers independently. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 25 individuals that were approached to be part of the study, 24 consented, comprising 8 females and 16 males, mean age 30 years. 17 individuals used TRAK for 16 weeks and were available for interview. Four physiotherapists were also interviewed. The six main themes identified from patients were: the experience of TRAK rehabilitation, personal characteristics for engagement, strengths and weaknesses of the intervention, TRAK in the future and attitudes to digital healthcare. The main themes from the physiotherapist interviews were: potential benefits, availability of resources and service organization to support use of TRAK. CONCLUSIONS: TRAK was found to be an acceptable method of delivering ACL rehabilitation alongside face-to-face physiotherapy. Patients reported that TRAK, specifically the videos, increased their confidence and motivation with their rehabilitation. They identified ways in which TRAK could be developed in the future to meet technological expectations and further support rehabilitation. For Physiotherapists time and availability of computers affected acceptability. Organization of care to support integration of digital exercise interventions such as TRAK into a blended approach to rehabilitation is required."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12891-017-1846-0,""Adult",Anterior Cruciate Ligament/physiology/surgery,Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries/*surgery,*Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,Exercise Therapy/*methods,Female,Humans,Knee Joint/physiology/surgery,

Many more individuals contemplate suicide. Understanding the attributes, characteristics, and exposures correlated with suicide remains an urgent and significant problem. As social networking sites have become more common, users have adopted these sites to talk about intensely personal topics, among them their thoughts about suicide. Such data has previously been evaluated by analyzing the language features of social media posts and using factors derived by domain experts to identify at-risk users. RESULTS: In this work, we automatically extract informal latent recurring topics of suicidal ideation found in social media posts. Our evaluation demonstrates that we are able to automatically reproduce many of the expertly determined risk factors for suicide. Moreover, we identify many informal latent topics related to suicide ideation such as concerns over health, work, self-image, and financial issues. CONCLUSIONS: These informal topics topics can be more specific or more general. Some of our topics express meaningful ideas not contained in the risk factors and some risk factors do not have complimentary latent topics. In short, our analysis of the latent topics extracted from social media containing suicidal ideations suggests that users of these systems express ideas that are complementary to the topics defined by experts but differ in their scope, focus, and precision of language."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2197-z,Adolescent",Algorithms,Automation,Female,Humans,*Information Storage and Retrieval,*Internet,Language,

These issues are amplified in low/middle-income countries with large deficits in experienced healthcare professionals. Automation has the ability to substantially reduce bottlenecks in the planning process but often require a high level of expertise to develop. PURPOSE: To implement the out of the box self-configuring nnU-Net package for the auto-segmentation of the organs at risk (OARs) and high-risk CTV (HR CTV) for Ring-Tandem (R-T) HDR cervical brachytherapy treatment planning. METHODS: The computed tomography (CT) scans of 100 previously treated patients were used to train and test three different nnU-Net configurations (2D, 3DFR, and 3DCasc). The performance of the models was evaluated by calculating the Sørensen-dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance (HD), 95(th) percentile Hausdorff distance, mean surface distance (MSD), and precision score for 20 test patients. The dosimetric accuracy between the manual and predicted contours was assessed by looking at the various dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters and volume differences. Three different radiation oncologists (ROs) scored the predicted bladder, rectum, and HR CTV contours generated by the best performing model. The manual contouring, prediction, and editing times were recorded. RESULTS: The mean DSC, HD, HD95, MSD and precision scores for our best performing model (3DFR) were 0.92/7.5 mm/3.0 mm/ 0.8 mm/0.91 for the bladder, 0.84/13.8 mm/5.3 mm/1.4 mm/0.84 for the rectum, and 0.81/8.5 mm/6.0 mm/2.2 mm/0.80 for the HR CTV. Mean dose differences (D(2cc/90%) ) and volume differences were 0.08 Gy/1.3 cm(3) for the bladder, 0.02 Gy/0.7 cm(3) for the rectum, and 0.33 Gy/1.5 cm(3) for the HR CTV. On average, 65% of the generated contours were clinically acceptable, 33% requiring minor edits, 2% required major edits, and no contours were rejected. Average manual contouring time was 14.0 min, while the average prediction and editing times were 1.6 and 2.1 min, respectively.

To date few are suitable for metabolomics datasets. The main objective of this work is to give a critical overview, for the first time, of the performance of these tools. To that aim, datasets from metabolomic repositories were selected and enriched data were created. Both types of data were analysed with these tools and outputs were thoroughly examined. RESULTS: An exploratory multivariate analysis of the most used tools for the enrichment of metabolite sets, based on a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of Jaccard's distances, was performed and mirrored their diversity. Codes (identifiers) of the metabolites of the datasets were searched in different metabolite databases (HMDB, KEGG, PubChem, ChEBI, BioCyc/HumanCyc, LipidMAPS, ChemSpider, METLIN and Recon2). The databases that presented more identifiers of the metabolites of the dataset were PubChem, followed by METLIN and ChEBI. However, these databases had duplicated entries and might present false positives. The performance of over-representation analysis (ORA) tools, including BioCyc/HumanCyc, ConsensusPathDB, IMPaLA, MBRole, MetaboAnalyst, Metabox, MetExplore, MPEA, PathVisio and Reactome and the mapping tool KEGGREST, was examined. Results were mostly consistent among tools and between real and enriched data despite the variability of the tools. Nevertheless, a few controversial results such as differences in the total number of metabolites were also found. Disease-based enrichment analyses were also assessed, but they were not found to be accurate probably due to the fact that metabolite disease sets are not up-to-date and the difficulty of predicting diseases from a list of metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: We have extensively reviewed the state-of-the-art of the available range of tools for metabolomic datasets, the completeness of metabolite databases, the performance of ORA methods and disease-based analyses. Despite the variability of the tools, they provided consistent results independent of their analytic approach. However, more work on the completeness of metabolite and pathway databases is required, which strongly affects the accuracy of enrichment analyses.

The proposed network incorporates a dual-phase approach: rapid delineation of regions of interest followed by semantic segmentation of the femur. The experimental dataset comprises 100 samples obtained from a hospital, partitioned into 85 for training, 8 for validation, and 7 for testing. In the first stage, the model achieves an average Intersection over Union of 0.9671 and a mean Average Precision of 0.9656, effectively delineating the femoral region with high accuracy. During the second stage, the network attains an average Dice coefficient of 0.953, sensitivity of 0.965, specificity of 0.998, and pixel accuracy of 0.996, ensuring precise segmentation of the femur. When compared to the single-stage SegResNet architecture, the proposed two-stage model demonstrates faster convergence during training, reduced inference times, higher segmentation accuracy, and overall superior performance. Comparative evaluations against the TransUnet model further highlight the network's notable advantages in accuracy and robustness. In summary, the proposed two-stage network offers an efficient, accurate, and autonomous solution for femur segmentation in large-scale and complex medical imaging datasets.

This paper outlines the systematic process that was used to design and develop the HealthMap program, prior to its evaluation in a cluster-randomised trial. METHODS: Program development, planning and evaluation was informed by the PRECEDE-PROCOEDE Model and an Intervention Mapping approach and involved four steps: (1) a multifaceted needs assessment", (2) the identification of intervention priorities, (3) exploration and identification of the antecedents and reinforcing factors required to initiate and sustain desired change of risk behaviours," and finally (4) the development of intervention goals, strategies and methods and integrating them into a comprehensive description of the intervention components.

As the prevalence of chronic disease increases with age, working beyond retirement may go along with having a chronic disease. Working beyond retirement may be different for retirees with and without chronic disease. We aim to investigate whether demographic, socioeconomic and work characteristics, health and social factors predict working beyond retirement, in workers with and without a chronic disease. METHODS: Employees aged 56-64 years were selected from the Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (N = 1125). Questionnaire data on demographic and work characteristics, health, social factors, and working beyond retirement were linked to registry data from Statistics Netherlands on socioeconomic characteristics. Separate prediction models were built for retirees with and without chronic disease using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Workers without chronic disease were more likely to work beyond retirement compared to workers with chronic disease (27% vs 23%). In retirees with chronic disease, work and health factors predicted working beyond retirement, while in retirees without a chronic disease, work, health and social factors predicted working beyond retirement. In the final model for workers with chronic disease, healthcare work, better physical health, higher body height, lower physical load and no permanent contract were positively predictive of working beyond retirement.

METHODS: This study proposes a Dual-Path Attention Mechanism (DPAM)-UNet model, which can automatically segment thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. Specifically, the model incorporates dual-path attention modules into the skip connections of the UNet network to capture global contextual information in feature maps. The model's performance was evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU), F1_score, accuracy, etc. Additionally, a new integrated loss function was designed for the DPAM-UNet network. RESULTS: Comparative experiments with classical segmentation models revealed that the DPAM-UNet model achieved an IoU of 0.7451, an F1_score of 0.8310, an accuracy of 0.9718, a precision of 0.8443, a recall of 0.8702, an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.9213, and an HD95 of 35.31.

Why do outcomes of so many clinical trials contradict each other? Why is the effectiveness of many drugs and other medical interventions so low? Why have prescription medications become the third leading cause of death in the US and Europe after cardiovascular diseases and cancer? In answering these questions, the main culprits identified so far have been various biases and conflicts of interest in planning, execution and analysis of clinical trials as well as reporting their outcomes. In this work, we take an in-depth look at statistical methodology used in planning clinical trials and analyzing trial data. We argue that this methodology is based on various questionable and empirically untestable assumptions, dubious approximations and arbitrary thresholds, and that it is deficient in many other respects. The most objectionable among these assumptions is that of distributional homogeneity of subjects' responses to medical interventions. We analyze this and other assumptions both theoretically and through clinical examples. Our main conclusion is that even a totally unbiased, perfectly randomized, reliably blinded, and faithfully executed clinical trial may still generate false and irreproducible results. We also formulate a few recommendations for the improvement of the design and statistical methodology of clinical trials informed by our analysis."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-017-0399-0,""Bias",Clinical Trials as Topic/*standards,"*Data Interpretation, Statistical",Humans,Reproducibility of Results,Sample Size,Stochastic Processes,"Treatment Outcome"",28830371,PMC5568363",

Limited capacity results in specialists declining referrals leaving primary care providers (PCP), patients, and specialists frustrated. Since specialist availability is unlikely to improve significantly, innovative solutions are required. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, safety and impact of a new referral triage option Triaging Referrals to eConsult (TReC) which enables specialists to provide advice in lieu of an appointment (advice only) or provide advice to support the PCP until the appointment occurs (advice and appointment). METHODS: Utilization metrics were prospectively collected (number (%) of referrals converted, time from receipt of referral to completion (response time) and specialist self-reported billing time. To assess PCP opinions on safety (advice was clearly identified and actionable) and acceptability (comfort in patient not seeing a specialist, additional time burden and support for expansion) two surveys, one for those referrals triaged to advice only and another for those triaged to advice and appointment, were faxed 14 days after the referral response. RESULTS: From November 1, 2022, to October 31, 2023, five specialties converted 930/16,880 referrals-656 (3.8%) to Advice Only and 274 (1.6%) to Advice and Appointment for an overall conversion rate of 5.5%. 192/1010 (19%) PCPs returned the survey with over 80% agreeing that the advice was easily recognizable, conversion to eConsult was acceptable and the advice was helpful and actionable.

Since the causes and pathogenesis of HELLP syndrome are not yet fully known and well understood, distinguishing it from other pregnancy-related disorders is complicated. Furthermore, late diagnosis leads to a delay in treatment, which challenges disease management. The present study aimed to present a machine learning (ML) attitude for diagnosing HELLP syndrome based on non-invasive parameters. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 384 patients in Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran, during 2010-2021 in four stages. In the first stage, data elements were identified using a literature review and Delphi method. Then, patient records were gathered, and in the third stage, the dataset was preprocessed and prepared for modeling. Finally, ML models were implemented, and their evaluation metrics were compared. RESULTS: A total of 21 variables were included in this study after the first stage. Among all the ML algorithms, multi-layer perceptron and deep learning performed the best, with an F1 score of more than 99%.In all three evaluation scenarios of 5fold and 10fold cross-validation, the K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and logistic regression (LR) had an F1 score of over 0.95, while this value was around 0.90 for support vector machine (SVM), and the lowest values were below 0.90 for decision tree (DT). According to the modeling output, some variables, such as platelet, gestational age, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were the most important in diagnosing HELLP syndrome. CONCLUSION: The present work indicated that ML algorithms can be used successfully in the development of HELLP syndrome diagnosis models. Other algorithms besides DTs have an F1 score above 0.90. In addition, this study demonstrated that biomarker features (among all features) have the most significant impact on the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-025-02904-0,Humans",*HELLP Syndrome/diagnosis,Female,Pregnancy,*Data Mining,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Machine Learning,Adult,

There is increasing attention for responsible research practices and implementation of reporting guidelines, but whether these efforts have improved the methodological quality of RCTs (e.g., lower risk of bias) is unknown. We, therefore, mapped risk-of-bias trends over time in RCT publications in relation to journal and author characteristics. Meta-information of 176,620 RCTs published between 1966 and 2018 was extracted. The risk-of-bias probability (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients/personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment) was assessed using a risk-of-bias machine learning tool. This tool was simultaneously validated using 63,327 human risk-of-bias assessments obtained from 17,394 RCTs evaluated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Moreover, RCT registration and CONSORT Statement reporting were assessed using automated searches. Publication characteristics included the number of authors, journal impact factor (JIF), and medical discipline. The annual number of published RCTs substantially increased over 4 decades, accompanied by increases in authors (5.2 to 7.8) and institutions (2.9 to 4.8). The risk of bias remained present in most RCTs but decreased over time for allocation concealment (63% to 51%), random sequence generation (57% to 36%), and blinding of outcome assessment (58% to 52%). Trial registration (37% to 47%) and the use of the CONSORT Statement (1% to 20%) also rapidly increased. In journals with a higher impact factor (>10), the risk of bias was consistently lower with higher levels of RCT registration and the use of the CONSORT Statement. Automated risk-of-bias predictions had accuracies above 70% for allocation concealment (70.7%), random sequence generation (72.1%), and blinding of patients/personnel (79.8%), but not for blinding of outcome assessment (62.7%). In conclusion, the likelihood of bias in RCTs has generally decreased over the last decades. This optimistic trend may be driven by increased knowledge augmented by mandatory trial registration and more stringent reporting guidelines and journal requirements. Nevertheless, relatively high probabilities of bias remain, particularly in journals with lower impact factors. This emphasizes that further improvement of RCT registration, conduct, and reporting is still urgently needed."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pbio.3001162,""Bias",Bibliometrics,Data Accuracy,Data Management/history/methods/standards/trends,"Databases, Bibliographic/history/standards/trends","History, 20th Century","History, 21st Century",Humans,

The dynamic nature of this technology creates unique challenges to evaluating safety and efficacy and minimizing harms. In response, regulators have proposed an approach that would shift more responsibility to MLPA developers for mitigating potential harms. To be effective, this approach requires MLPA developers to recognize, accept, and act on responsibility for mitigating harms. In interviews of 40 MLPA developers of health care applications in the United States, we found that a subset of ML developers made statements reflecting moral disengagement, representing several different potential rationales that could create distance between personal accountability and harms. However, we also found a different subset of ML developers who expressed recognition of their role in creating potential hazards, the moral weight of their design decisions, and a sense of responsibility for mitigating harms. We also found evidence of moral conflict and uncertainty about responsibility for averting harms as an individual developer working in a company. These findings suggest possible facilitators and barriers to the development of ethical ML that could act through encouragement of moral engagement or discouragement of moral disengagement.

Systematizing the data extraction automatically using machine-learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) is desirable to reduce the human labor required to populate the SEER database and to improve the timeliness of the data. This enables scaling up registry efficiency and collection of new data elements. To ensure the integrity, quality, and continuity of the SEER data, the misclassification error of ML and NPL algorithms needs to be negligible. Current algorithms fail to achieve the precision of human experts who can bring additional information in their assessments. Differences in registry format and the desire to develop a common information extraction platform further complicate the ML/NLP tasks. The purpose of our study is to develop triage rules to partially automate registry workflow to improve the precision of the auto-extracted information. RESULTS: This paper presents a mathematical framework to improve the precision of a classifier beyond that of the Bayes classifier by selectively classifying item that are most likely to be correct. This results in a triage rule that only classifies a subset of the item. We characterize the optimal triage rule and demonstrate its usefulness in the problem of classifying cancer site from electronic pathology reports to achieve a desired precision.

This study investigates the advantages of automated VMAT planning for this site compared to manual VMAT planning by expert planners. METHODS: For 20 gastric cancer patients in the postoperative/adjuvant setting, dual-arc VMAT plans were generated using fully automated multi-criterial treatment planning (autoVMAT), and compared to manually generated VMAT plans (manVMAT). Both automated and manual plans were created to deliver a median dose of 45 Gy to the PTV using identical planning and segmentation parameters. Plans were evaluated by two expert radiation oncologists for clinical acceptability. AutoVMAT and manVMAT plans were also compared based on dose-volume histogram (DVH) and predicted normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) analysis. RESULTS: Both manVMAT and autoVMAT plans were considered clinically acceptable. Target coverage was similar (manVMAT: 96.6 ± 1.6%, autoVMAT: 97.4 ± 1.0%, p = 0.085). With autoVMAT, median kidney dose was reduced on average by > 25%", (for left kidney from 11.3 ± 2.1 Gy to 8.9 ± 3.5 Gy (p = 0.002)," for right kidney from 9.2 ± 2.2 Gy to 6.1 ± 1.3 Gy (p <  0.001)).

Substantial improvements in dose conformity and integral dose were achieved with autoVMAT plans (4.2% and 9.1%, respectively"," p <  0.001). Due to the better OAR sparing in the autoVMAT plans compared to manVMAT plans, the predicted NTCPs for the left and right kidney and the liver-PTV were significantly reduced by 11.3%, 12.8%, 7%, respectively (p = 0.001).

Genome-wide association studies are a useful tool for revealing potential causal genetic variants, but in this context, epistasis is generally ignored. Data complexity and interpretation issues make it difficult to process and interpret epistasis. As the number of interaction grows exponentially with the number of variants, computational limitation is a bottleneck. Gene Network based strategies have been successful in integrating biological data and identifying relevant hub genes and pathways related to complex traits. In this study, epistatic interactions and network-based analysis are combined in the Weighted Interaction SNP hub (WISH) method and implemented in an efficient and easy to use R package. RESULTS: The WISH R package (WISH-R) was developed to calculate epistatic interactions on a genome-wide level based on genomic data. It is easy to use and install, and works on regular genomic data. The package filters data based on linkage disequilibrium and calculates epistatic interaction coefficients between SNP pairs based on a parallelized efficient linear model and generalized linear model implementations. Normalized epistatic coefficients are analyzed in a network framework, alleviating multiple testing issues and integrating biological signal to identify modules and pathways related to complex traits. Functions for visualizing results and testing runtimes are also provided. CONCLUSION: The WISH-R package is an efficient implementation for analyzing genome-wide epistasis for complex diseases and traits. It includes methods and strategies for analyzing epistasis from initial data filtering until final data interpretation.

Little is known on how local clinicians perceive the use and impact of these tools in their daily practice. This study investigates clinician insights on an eIMCI tool. Specifically, we report their views on its medical content, assess their knowledge on microbes, antimicrobials and the development of resistance. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in the frame of a large-scale implementation in Burkina Faso of an eIMCI tool developed by the Swiss NGO Terre des hommes. Twelve in-depth interviews and 2 focus-group discussions were conducted including 21 health workers from 10 primary care facilities. Emerging themes were identified using qualitative data analysis software. RESULTS: eIMCI users expressed a high level of satisfaction, slowness of the tablet was perceived as the major inconvenience limiting uptake. Several frequent illnesses were identified as missing in the algorithm along with guidance for fever without focus. When asked about existing types of microbes, 9 and 4 out of 21 participants could mention bacteria and virus respectively"," only 5 correctly answered that antibiotics had no action on viral disease and 6 mentioned the risk of antibiotic resistance. Level of knowledge was higher in nurses than in less trained health workers. The tool was perceived as improving patient management and the rational use of antibiotics. Positive changes in health facility organisation were reported, such as task shifting and improved triage. eIMCI was also perceived as a learning tool, and users expressed a strong desire to expand the geographic and temporal scope of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The use of eICMI was widely accepted and perceived as a powerful tool guiding daily practice. Findings suggest that it has positive effects on the health care system beyond the quality of consultation. To support large uptake and sustainability, better training of health workers in infectiology is essential and the medical content of eIMCI should be optimized to include frequent diseases and, for each of them, the appropriate management plan."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12889-019-6692-6,""Adult",Algorithms,Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use,*Attitude of Health Personnel,Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/microbiology,Burkina Faso/epidemiology,Child,

Telemedicine practice requires complex disease management, advocating that the nurses' reasoning and decision-making processes are supported. Computerised decision support systems are being used increasingly to assist reasoning and decision-making in different situations. However, little research has focused on the clinical reasoning of nurses using a computerised decision support system in a telemedicine setting. Therefore, the objective of the study is to explore the process of telemedicine nurses' clinical reasoning when using a computerised decision support system for the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The factors influencing the reasoning and decision-making processes were investigated. METHODS: In this ethnographic study, a combination of data collection methods, including participatory observations, the think-aloud technique, and a focus group interview was employed. Collected data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: When telemedicine nurses used a computerised decision support system for the management of patients with complex, unstable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, two categories emerged: """"the process of telemedicine nurses' reasoning to assess health change"""" and """"the influence of the telemedicine setting on nurses' reasoning and decision-making processes"""". An overall theme, termed """"advancing beyond the system"""", represented the connection between the reasoning processes and the telemedicine work and setting, where being familiar with the patient functioned as a foundation for the nurses' clinical reasoning process. CONCLUSION: In the telemedicine setting, when supported by a computerised decision support system, nurses' reasoning was enabled by the continuous flow of digital clinical data, regular video-mediated contact and shared decision-making with the patient. These factors fostered an in-depth knowledge of the patients and acted as a foundation for the nurses' reasoning process. Nurses' reasoning frequently advanced beyond the computerised decision support system recommendations. Future studies are warranted to develop more accurate algorithms, increase system maturity, and improve the integration of the digital clinical information with clinical experiences, to support telemedicine nurses' reasoning process."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-017-0573-7,""Adult","Anthropology, Cultural",Clinical Decision-Making/*methods,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Norway,

Decision-making processes within MDTs, while critical, contribute to increased healthcare costs due to the need for specialist time and coordination. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of clinical decision-making processes, potentially reducing costs associated with traditional MDT models. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 171 consecutively treated patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Relevant structured clinical data and the European Association of Urology (EAU) pocket guidelines were provided to two LLMs (chatGPT-4, Claude-3-Opus). LLM treatment recommendations were compared to actual treatment recommendations of the MDT meeting (MDM). RESULTS: Both LLMs demonstrated an overall adherence of 93% with the MDT treatment recommendations. Discrepancies between LLM and MDT recommendations were observed in 15 cases (9%), primarily due to lack of clinical information that could be provided to the LLMs. In 5 cases (3%), the LLM recommendations were not in line with EAU guidelines despite having access to all relevant information. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that LLMs can provide accurate treatment recommendations for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. LLMs have the potential to streamline MDT workflows, enabling specialists to focus on complex cases and patient-centered discussions. In this study, we explored the potential of artificial intelligence models called large language models (LLMs) to assist in treatment decision-making for prostate cancer patients. We found that LLMs, when provided with patient information and clinical guidelines, can recommend treatments that closely match those made by a team of cancer specialists, suggesting that LLMs could help streamline the decision-making process and potentially reduce healthcare costs."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00345-024-05423-1,""Humans",Male,*Prostatic Neoplasms/therapy,Retrospective Studies,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",Aged,Middle Aged,"Clinical Decision-Making"",39804478,",

Protocols often include references to equipment, reagents, descriptions of critical steps, troubleshooting and tips, as well as any other information that researchers deem important for facilitating the reusability of the protocol. Although experimental protocols are central to reproducibility, the descriptions are often cursory. There is the need for a unified framework with respect to the syntactic structure and the semantics for representing experimental protocols. RESULTS: In this paper we present """"SMART Protocols ontology"""", an ontology for representing experimental protocols. Our ontology represents the protocol as a workflow with domain specific knowledge embedded within a document. We also present the S ample I nstrument R eagent O bjective (SIRO) model, which represents the minimal common information shared across experimental protocols. SIRO was conceived in the same realm as the Patient Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) model that supports search, retrieval and classification purposes in evidence based medicine. We evaluate our approach against a set of competency questions modeled as SPARQL queries and processed against a set of published and unpublished protocols modeled with the SP Ontology and the SIRO model. Our approach makes it possible to answer queries such as Which protocols use tumor tissue as a sample.

METHODS: Secondary analyses of the cluster-randomized AgeWell.de-trial, testing a multidomain intervention (optimization of nutrition and medication, enhancement of physical, social and cognitive activity) in older adults at increased dementia risk. Intervention effects on a healthy diet (composite score) and its components were analyzed using Poisson- and logistic regression analyses. Stages of behavior change (transtheoretical model), and respective changes between baseline and follow-up were analyzed using mixed regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 819 individuals were analyzed (M(age) = 69.0, SD = 4.9, n(intervention/control group) = 378/441). We observed a significant intervention effect on the healthy diet score (b = 0.06, IRR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.11). Changes were particularly due to increased fruit- and vegetable consumption, while other food components were not improved by the intervention. The intervention did not induce transitions to advanced stages of behavior change regarding a healthy diet, however, participants in the control group moved to initial stages of behavior change (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.92). CONCLUSION: A multidomain lifestyle intervention improved participants' diet and maintained motivation to change in an at-risk-sample. However, only fruit- and vegetable consumption increased. Additional support might be necessary to encourage older adults to integrate new, healthier food components into their diet.

A comparison of the long-term mortality between the two cohorts through follow-up until 2011 was performed. RESULTS: Geriatric participants with SA had a significantly increased mortality than those without SA [Adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-1.66], particularly the old elderly (= 85 years, AHR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.58-2.84) and males (AHR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.33-1.79).

A nexus of data ethics issues is the concept of creep, or repurposing of data for other applications or research beyond the conditions of original collection. Data creep has proven controversial and has prompted concerns about the scope of ethical oversight. Institutional review boards offer little guidance regarding big data, and problematic research can still meet ethical standards. While ethics seem concrete through institutional deployment, I frame ethics as produced. Informed by my ethnographic research at a large public university in the U.S., I explore ethics through two models: ethics as institutional procedures and ethics as acts and intentions. The university where I conducted fieldwork is the development grounds for a predictive model that uses student data to anticipate academic success. While students consent to data collection, the circumstances of consent and the degree to which they are informed are not so apparent, as many data are a product of creep. Drawing from interviews and participant observation with administrators, data scientists, developers, and students, I examine data ethics, from a larger institutional model to everyday enactments related to data creep. After demonstrating the limits of such models, I propose a remodeling of ethics that draws on recent works on data, justice, and refusal to pose generative questions for rethinking ethics in institutional contexts."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Monique""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11948-021-00346-1,""Big Data",Data Collection,"*Ethics Committees, Research",Humans,Informed Consent,Organizations,"*Social Justice"",34796403,",,

To that end, we developed ISLE, an intelligent streaming framework to address inefficiencies in current imaging infrastructures. Our framework draws inspiration from video-on-demand platforms to intelligently stream medical images to AI vendors at an optimal resolution for inference from a single high-resolution copy using progressive encoding. We hypothesize that ISLE can dramatically reduce the bandwidth and computational requirements for AI inference, while increasing throughput (i.e., the number of scans processed by the AI system per second). We evaluate our framework by streaming chest X-rays for classification and abdomen CT scans for liver and spleen segmentation and comparing them with the original versions of each dataset. For classification, our results show that ISLE reduced data transmission and decoding time by at least 92% and 88%, respectively, while increasing throughput by more than 3.72 × .

To monitor this goal of inclusion, CRPD's Article 31 requires state parties to collect data about the situation of persons with disabilities. The Disability Statistics - Questionnaire Review Database (DS-QR Database) reports on whether population and housing censuses and household surveys include internationally recommended disability questions for adults ages 15 and older. METHODS: The Disability Data Initiative (DDI), an international consortium of researchers, regularly retrieves and analyses a list of surveys and censuses from international catalogs, libraries and websites of national statistics offices. Questionnaires are reviewed to identify if they include internationally recommended questions on functional difficulties (e.g. difficulty seeing), more specifically (i) the Washington Group Short Set (WG-SS) or (ii) questions that meet at least the United Nations 2017 guidelines for disability measurement in censuses (other functional difficulty questions thereafter). RESULTS: The DS-QR Database includes the review results for the questionnaires of 3027 population censuses and surveys from 199 countries and territories collected from 2009 to 2023. The review has information on whether each dataset has the WG-SS or other functional difficulty questions and overall results per country, region, type of dataset and over time. CONCLUSION: By identifying countries that collect internationally comparable disability data, the DS-QR Database can help researchers, policymakers and advocates determine whether countries fulfill their obligations as per CRPD Article 31. It can also assist in identifying which datasets use functional difficulty questions and can be used to research and monitor disability rights over time and across countries.

The intervention was associated with improved CVD risk factor screening but there was no improvement in prescribing rates of guideline-recommended medicines. The aim of this study was to conduct a process evaluation to identify and explain the underlying mechanisms by which the intervention did and did not have an impact. METHODS/DESIGN: Normalisation process theory (NPT) was used to understand factors that supported or constrained normalisation of the intervention into routine practice. A case study design was used in which six of the 30 participating intervention sites were purposively sampled to obtain a mix of size, governance, structure and performance. Multiple data sources were drawn on including trial outcome data, surveys of job satisfaction and team climate (68 staff) and in-depth interviews (19 staff). Data were primarily analysed within cases and compared with quantitative findings in other trial intervention and usual care sites. RESULTS: We found a complex interaction between implementation processes and several contextual factors affecting uptake of the intervention. There was no clear association between team climate, job satisfaction and intervention outcomes. There were four spheres of influence that appeared to enhance or detract from normalisation of the intervention: organisational mission and history (e.g. strategic investment to promote a QI culture enhanced cognitive participation), leadership (e.g. ability to energise or demotivate others influenced coherence), team environment (e.g. synergistic activities of team members with different skill sets influenced collective action) and technical integrity of the intervention (e.g. tools that slowed computer systems limited reflective action). DISCUSSION: Use of NPT helped explain how certain contextual factors influence the work that is done by individuals and teams when implementing a novel intervention. Although these factors do not necessarily distil into a recipe for successful uptake, they may assist system planners, intervention developers, and health professionals to better understand the trajectory that primary health care services may take when developing and engaging with QI interventions.

However, existing biological age predictors are mostly based on European populations and overlook the widespread nonlinear effects of clinical biomarkers. METHODS: Using data from the prospective Dongfeng-Tongji (DFTJ) cohort of elderly Chinese, we propose a physiological aging index (PAI) based on 36 routine clinical biomarkers to measure aging progress. We first determined the optimal level of each biomarker by restricted cubic spline Cox models. For biomarkers with a U-shaped relationship with mortality, we derived new variables to model their distinct effects below and above the optimal levels. We defined PAI as a weighted sum of variables predictive of mortality selected by a LASSO Cox model. To measure aging acceleration, we defined ?PAI as the residual of PAI after regressing on CA. We evaluated the predictive value of ?PAI on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the DFTJ cohort, as well as nine major chronic diseases in the UK Biobank (UKB). RESULTS: In the DFTJ training set (n = 12,769, median follow-up: 10.38 years), we identified 25 biomarkers with significant nonlinear associations with mortality, of which 11 showed insignificant linear associations. By incorporating nonlinear effects, we selected CA and 17 clinical biomarkers to calculate PAI. In the DFTJ testing set (n = 15,904, 5.87 years), PAI predict mortality with a concordance index (C-index) of 0.816 (95% confidence interval, [0.796, 0.837]), better than CA (C-index = 0.771 [0.755, 0.788]) and PhenoAge (0.799 [0.784, 0.814]). ?PAI was predictive of incident CVD and its subtypes, independent of traditional risk factors. In the external validation set of UKB (n = 296,931, 12.80 years), PAI achieved a C-index of 0.749 (0.746, 0.752) to predict mortality, remaining better than CA (0.706 [0.702, 0.709]) and PhenoAge (0.743 [0.739, 0.746]). In both DFTJ and UKB, PAI calibrated better than PhenoAge when comparing the predicted and observed survival probabilities. Furthermore, ?PAI outperformed any single biomarker to predict incident risks of eight age-related chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the potential of PAI and ?PAI as integrative biomarkers to evaluate aging acceleration and facilitate the development of targeted intervention strategies for healthy aging."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12916-024-03769-2,""Humans",Aged,*Biomarkers,Prospective Studies,*Aging/physiology,Female,Male,United Kingdom/epidemiology,*Smartphone/statistics & numerical data

AIM: This study aims to evaluate the impact of a digital detox intervention on reducing anxiety and depression among young adults across diverse demographic backgrounds. METHODS: A pre-test, followed by a digital detox intervention, and a post-test using an online survey was carried out. The sample comprised 467 participants (51.6% males, 48.4% females) aged 18-30 years, with varied employment statuses. Participants' anxiety and depression levels were assessed before and after a two-week-long digital detox intervention, which encouraged reduced digital device usage.

The absence of shared metrics for success or achievements in sustainability is however critically lacking. We propose a simple metric, free of causal inference, which can be used to test different empirical models for the sustainment of health outcomes. METHODS: We follow the suggestion of Chambers and use """"sustainment"""" to refer to the verifiable and measured extent to which a health indicator has evolved over time. The sustainment index of a health indicator (Y) advanced by a program is based on a simple-to-calculate approximation of the derivative of Y over time (T0: baseline, T1: endline, and T2: post-project), based on the ratio of the slope of Y(T1-T2) over Y(T0-T1). SI(Y) = 1 (Y(T1-T2) / Y(T0-T1)). RESULTS: This construct provides three clear benchmarks: SI = 0, when the health indicator returns to baseline value post-project (Y(T2) = Y(T0))"," SI = 1, when the endline-post-project trend is a plateau"," and SI = 2, when the progress slope during program is uninterrupted post-program. We find strong correlation (r(2) = 0.922) between the SI and independent practitioners' rating of indicator trends. The SI shows different levels of achieved sustainment for a range of indicators in a published ex-post sustainability study. And we find that the SI can be computed for large national datasets for two types of indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The Sustainment Index has limitations and conditions of applicability, but it can be applied to different datasets and studies to provide a reliable dependent measure of the level of sustainment of health outcomes from one period of time to the next. The Index will need additional testing, and future evaluation-research work will need to consider index performance under different situations. The Sustainment Index has the potential to provide a standard metric to build evidence through more systematic research on sustainment and sustainability."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-3340-2,""Benchmarking/*methods","Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data",*Health Status Indicators,Health Surveys,Humans,"Models, Theoretical",

If we can detect the DR related risk factors more accurately, we can then exercise early prevention strategies for diabetic retinopathy in the most high-risk population. The purpose of this study is to build a prediction model for the DR in type 2 diabetes mellitus using data mining techniques including the support vector machines, decision trees, artificial neural networks, and logistic regressions. RESULTS: Experimental results demonstrated that prediction performance by support vector machines performed better than the other machine learning algorithms and achieved 79.5% and 0.839 in accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using percentage split (i.e., data set divided into 80% as trainning and 20% as test), respectively. Evaluated by three-way data split scheme (i.e., data set divided into 60% as training, 20% as validation, and 20% as independent test), our method obtained slightly lower performance compared to percentage split, which suggested that three-way data split is a better way to evaluate the real performance and prevent overestimation. Moreover, we incorporated approaches proposed in previous studies to evaluate our data set and our prediction performance outperformed the other previous studies in most evaluation measures. This lends support to our assumption that appropriate machine learning algorithms combined with discriminative clinical features can effectively detect diabetic retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Our method identifies use of insulin and duration of diabetes as novel interpretable features to assist with clinical decisions in identifying the high-risk populations for diabetic retinopathy. If duration of DM increases by 1 year, the odds ratio to have DMR is increased by 9.3%. The odds ratio to have DR is increased by 3.561 times for patients who use insulin compared to patients who do not use insulin. Our results can be used to facilitate development of clinical decision support systems for clinical practice in the future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2277-0,""Adult",Aged,"Aged, 80 and over",*Algorithms,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications",Diabetic Retinopathy/*diagnosis/etiology,Female,

METHODS: CloudMC has been developed over Microsoft Azure cloud. It is based on a map/reduce implementation for Monte Carlo calculations distribution over a dynamic cluster of virtual machines in order to reduce calculation time. CloudMC has been updated with new methods to read and process the information related to radiotherapy treatment verification: CT image set, treatment plan, structures and dose distribution files in DICOM format. Some tests have been designed in order to determine, for the different tasks, the most suitable type of virtual machines from those available in Azure.

Linkage of different RWE data types could address such limitations by enriching data and improving scientific quality. Using the example of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Germany, this study assessed the value of data linkage between primary and secondary data sources for RWE. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of data from an observational RWE study, which used prospectively collected data and data from an insurance claims database to assess treatment adherence and persistence in patients with COPD in Germany. Patient-level primary data were collected from the prospective observational study (primary dataset, N = 636), and claims data from the sickness fund AOK Nordost (claims dataset, N = 74,916). Primary and claims data were linked at a patient level using insurance numbers (linked dataset). Patients in the linked dataset were indexed at date of study inclusion for primary data and matched calendar date for claims data. Agreement between primary and claims data was examined for patients in the linked dataset based on comparisons between recorded sociodemographic data at index, comorbidities (primary: any recorded"," claims: pre-index), prescriptions for COPD therapies (type and date) and exacerbations in the 12-month post-index period. RESULTS: The linked dataset included primary and claims data for 536 patients. Fewer comorbid patients were reported in primary data compared with claims data (p < 0.001), with overall agreement between 63.6% (hypertension) and 90.5% (osteoporosis). Number of prescriptions for COPD therapies per patient was lower in primary versus claims data (3.7 vs 10.3 prescriptions, respectively), with only 24.5% of prescriptions recorded in both datasets. Only 11.5% of exacerbations (moderate or severe) were recorded in both datasets, with 15.5% recorded only in primary data and 73.0% recorded only in claims data. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted discrepancies between primary and claims data capture for this population of German patients with COPD, with lower reporting of comorbidities, COPD therapy prescriptions and exacerbations in primary versus claims data.

It is important to identify DDIs before drugs are used in the market. However, preclinical identification of DDIs requires much money and time. Computational approaches have exhibited their abilities to predict potential DDIs on a large scale by utilizing pre-market drug properties (e.g. chemical structure). Nevertheless, none of them can predict two comprehensive types of DDIs, including enhancive and degressive DDIs, which increases and decreases the behaviors of the interacting drugs respectively. There is a lack of systematic analysis on the structural relationship among known DDIs. Revealing such a relationship is very important, because it is able to help understand how DDIs occur. Both the prediction of comprehensive DDIs and the discovery of structural relationship among them play an important guidance when making a co-prescription. RESULTS: In this work, treating a set of comprehensive DDIs as a signed network, we design a novel model (DDINMF) for the prediction of enhancive and degressive DDIs based on semi-nonnegative matrix factorization. Inspiringly, DDINMF achieves the conventional DDI prediction (AUROC = 0.872 and AUPR = 0.605) and the comprehensive DDI prediction (AUROC = 0.796 and AUPR = 0.579). Compared with two state-of-the-art approaches, DDINMF shows it superiority. Finally, representing DDIs as a binary network and a signed network respectively, an analysis based on NMF reveals crucial knowledge hidden among DDIs. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach is able to predict not only conventional binary DDIs but also comprehensive DDIs. More importantly, it reveals several key points about the DDI network: (1) both binary and signed networks show fairly clear clusters, in which both drug degree and the difference between positive degree and negative degree show significant distribution", (2) the drugs having large degrees tend to have a larger difference between positive degree and negative degree," (3) though the binary DDI network contains no information about enhancive and degressive DDIs at all, it implies some of their relationship in the comprehensive DDI matrix"," (4) the occurrence of signs indicating enhancive and degressive DDIs is not random because the comprehensive DDI network is equipped with a structural balance."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12918-018-0532-7,Algorithms",Computational Biology/*methods,"*Drug Interactions,29671393,PMC5907306",,,

Common examples are pharmacokinetic modeling in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT), apparent diffusion coefficient calculations and intravoxel incoherent motion modeling in diffusion-weighted MRI and Z-spectra analysis in chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI. Most available software tools are limited to a special purpose and do not allow for own developments and extensions. Furthermore, they are mostly designed as stand-alone solutions using external frameworks and thus cannot be easily incorporated natively in the analysis workflow. RESULTS: We present a framework for medical image fitting tasks that is included in the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit MITK, following a rigorous open-source, well-integrated and operating system independent policy. Software engineering-wise, the local models, the fitting infrastructure and the results representation are abstracted and thus can be easily adapted to any model fitting task on image data, independent of image modality or model. Several ready-to-use libraries for model fitting and use-cases, including fit evaluation and visualization, were implemented. Their embedding into MITK allows for easy data loading, pre- and post-processing and thus a natural inclusion of model fitting into an overarching workflow. As an example, we present a comprehensive set of plug-ins for the analysis of DCE MRI data, which we validated on existing and novel digital phantoms, yielding competitive deviations between fit and ground truth. CONCLUSIONS: Providing a very flexible environment, our software mainly addresses developers of medical imaging software that includes model fitting algorithms and tools. Additionally, the framework is of high interest to users in the domain of perfusion MRI, as it offers feature-rich, freely available, validated tools to perform pharmacokinetic analysis on DCE MRI data, with both interactive and automatized batch processing workflows."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2588-1,""*Algorithms",*Contrast Media,Diagnostic Imaging/*methods,Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods,Glioblastoma/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging,Humans,Image Enhancement/methods,*Software,

However, secondary outcomes, such as the impact of weight reduction on patient experience, like health-related quality of life (HRQoL), have increasingly been recognized as important. Therefore, a review was conducted to determine the Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs) and Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) used in clinical trials for obesity to assess the patient experience. METHODS: Two clinical trial databases (United States & European Union) were reviewed to identify Phase 2-4 clinical trials for obesity (2018-2023). A targeted literature review was also conducted using the OVID database to identify clinical trial for obesity publications which included COAs/DHTs (2010-2023). RESULT: Trials from the databases (n = 53) and publications (n = 42) were included in data extraction (N = 73). This resulted in identification of 108 COAs, the majority being patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures (n = 83), but also 24 performance outcomes (PerfO) measures, and 1 composite PRO-clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO) measure, as well as 2 DHTs. The most frequently identified PRO measures were the Short Form 36 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Lite Clinical Trials. Twenty-four PerfO measures were also identified, with the 6-minute walk test being most common. These measures were most often used to construct secondary endpoints, with physical function (PF) being the most frequently specified domain. PRO measures assessing eating-related thoughts/behaviours, physical activity, and disordered eating were also frequently included, although individual measures varied widely across trials. CONCLUSION: Review of COAs and DHTs in registered clinical trials and publications for obesity found that PRO measures were the most common type of COA used to develop endpoints with current use of DHTs limited. Specifically, the physical function domain of multidimensional patient-reported outcome measures assessing health-related quality of life were often used to construct secondary endpoints. Further work is warranted to assess how the COAs and DHT data collected in clinical trials are viewed by regulators and payers."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s41687-025-00841-0,""Humans",*Obesity/therapy,*Patient Reported Outcome Measures,*Quality of Life,*Clinical Trials as Topic/methods,"Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods",Weight Loss,"Digital Health"",39976863,PMC11842654",

Command-line utilities further benefit by relieving bioinformatics developers to learn the use of, or to interact directly with, biological software libraries. There is however a lack of command-line utilities that leverage popular Open Source biological software toolkits such as BioPerl ( http://bioperl.org ) to make many of the well-designed, robust, and routinely used biological classes available for a wider base of end users. RESULTS: Designed as standard utilities for UNIX-family operating systems, BpWrapper makes functionality of some of the most popular BioPerl modules readily accessible on the command line to novice as well as to experienced bioinformatics practitioners. The initial release of BpWrapper includes four utilities with concise command-line user interfaces, bioseq, bioaln, biotree, and biopop, specialized for manipulation of molecular sequences, sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, and DNA polymorphisms, respectively. Over a hundred methods are currently available as command-line options and new methods are easily incorporated. Performance of BpWrapper utilities lags that of precompiled utilities while equivalent to that of other utilities based on BioPerl. BpWrapper has been tested on BioPerl Release 1.6, Perl versions 5.10.1 to 5.25.10, and operating systems including Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, and GNU/Linux. Release code is available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::BPWrapper . Source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/bioperl/p5-bpwrapper . CONCLUSIONS: BpWrapper improves on existing sequence utilities by following the design principles of Unix text utilities such including a concise user interface, extensive command-line options, and standard input/output for serialized operations. Further, dozens of novel methods for manipulation of sequences, alignments, and phylogenetic trees, unavailable in existing utilities (e.g., EMBOSS, Newick Utilities, and FAST), are provided.

A professional data warehouse (DWH) established in 2010 hosts all of the residents' data. Inside this information system (IS), clinical narratives (CNs) were used only by medical staff as a residents' care linking tool. The objective of this study was to show that, through qualitative and quantitative textual analysis of a relatively small physiotherapy and well-defined CN sample, it was possible to build a physiotherapy corpus and, through this process, generate a new body of knowledge by adding relevant information to describe the residents' care and lives. METHODS: Meaningful words were extracted through Standard Query Language (SQL) with the LIKE function and wildcards to perform pattern matching, followed by text mining and a word cloud using R® packages. Another step involved principal components and multiple correspondence analyses, plus clustering on the same residents' sample as well as on other health data using a health model measuring the residents' care level needs. RESULTS: By combining these techniques, physiotherapy treatments could be characterized by a list of constructed keywords, and the residents' health characteristics were built. Feeding defects or health outlier groups could be detected, physiotherapy residents' data and their health data were matched, and differences in health situations showed qualitative and quantitative differences in physiotherapy narratives. CONCLUSIONS: This textual experiment using a textual process in two stages showed that text mining and data mining techniques provide convenient tools to improve residents' health and quality of care by adding new, simple, useable data to the electronic health record (EHR).

As the digitalization of health care accelerates, POs are challenged to adapt their diverse roles to digital formats. However, the extent and form of POs' digital adaptation and the challenges POs encounter in their digital transformation remain unexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the digital transformation processes within POs. We examined the types of digital activities and processes implemented, people involved in respective tasks, challenges encountered, and attitudes toward the digitalization of POs. METHODS: The study was carried out by the multicenter interdisciplinary research network Pandora. We adopted a qualitative exploratory approach by conducting 37 semistructured interviews and 2 focus groups with representatives and members of POs in Germany. Results were obtained using a deductive-inductive approach based on a qualitative content analysis. Methods and results were reported in accordance with the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) checklist. RESULTS: POs primarily apply basic digital tools to engage in communication, health education, and information dissemination. Some also develop specific mobile apps and collect health data through patient registries. Volunteers cover a considerable part of the workload. Sometimes, POs collaborate with external partners, such as health professionals or other nonprofit organizations. Furthermore, many (13/46, 28%) interviewees referred to the importance of involving members in digitalization efforts to better meet their needs. However, they described the actual practices used to involve members in, for example, developing digital services as limited, passive, or implicit. When evaluating digital transformation processes, representatives and members of POs expressed generally positive attitudes and acknowledged their potential to improve the accessibility of support services, management efficiency, and outreach. Still, resource constraints", the complexity of digital initiatives," and accessibility issues for certain demographic groups, especially older persons, were frequently mentioned as challenges. Several (15/46, 33%) interviewees highlighted POs' increasing responsibility to support their members' digital competencies and digital health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: POs are actively involved in the digital transformation of health services. To navigate challenges and further shape and sustain digital activities and processes, POs may benefit from governance frameworks, that is, a clear plan outlining with whom, how, and with what objectives digital projects are being realized.

As the face is the basic means of social interactions and emotional expressions among humans, individuals afflicted can often be introverted and may develop psychological distress, which can be even more severe than the physical disability. This paper addresses the problem of objective facial paralysis evaluation. METHODS: We present a novel approach for objective facial paralysis evaluation and classification, which is crucial for deciding the medical treatment scheme. For FP classification, in particular, we proposed a method based on the ensemble of regression trees to efficiently extract facial salient points and detect iris or sclera boundaries. We also employ 2(nd) degree polynomial of parabolic function to improve Daugman's algorithm for detecting occluded iris boundaries, thereby allowing us to efficiently get the area of the iris. The symmetry score of each face is measured by calculating the ratio of both iris area and the distances between the key points in both sides of the face. We build a model by employing hybrid classifier that discriminates healthy from unhealthy subjects and performs FP classification. RESULTS: Objective analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. As we explore the effect of data augmentation using publicly available datasets of facial expressions, experiments reveal that the proposed approach demonstrates efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Extraction of iris and facial salient points on images based on ensemble of regression trees along with our hybrid classifier (classification tree plus regularized logistic regression) provides a more improved way of addressing FP classification problem. It addresses the common limiting factor introduced in the previous works, i.e. having the greater sensitivity to subjects exposed to peculiar facial images, whereby improper identification of initial evolving curve for facial feature segmentation results to inaccurate facial feature extraction. Leveraging ensemble of regression trees provides accurate salient points extraction, which is crucial for revealing the significant difference between the healthy and the palsy side when performing different facial expressions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12880-019-0330-8,""Algorithms",Facial Paralysis/*classification/psychology,Humans,"Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods","Introversion, Psychological",Regression Analysis,"Sensitivity and Specificity"",31023253,PMC6485055",,

This study aimed to define medical AI competencies and identify the essential competencies for medical graduates in South Korea. METHOD: An initial Delphi survey conducted in 2022 involving 4 groups of medical AI experts (n = 28) yielded 42 competency items. Subsequently, an online questionnaire survey was carried out with 1,955 participants (1,174 students and 781 professors) from medical schools across South Korea, utilizing the list of 42 competencies developed from the first Delphi round. A subsequent Delphi survey was conducted with 33 medical educators from 21 medical schools to differentiate the essential AI competencies from the optional ones. RESULTS: The study identified 6 domains encompassing 36 AI competencies essential for medical graduates: (1) understanding digital health and changes driven by AI", (2) fundamental knowledge and skills in medical AI, (3) ethics and legal aspects in the use of medical AI, (4) medical AI application in clinical practice," (5) processing, analyzing, and evaluating medical data"," and (6) research and development of medical AI, as well as subcompetencies within each domain.

However, life sciences research is becoming increasingly transdisciplinary and integrative, fostering the need to develop matching strategies that are able to handle multiple ontologies and more complex relations between their concepts. RESULTS: We have developed ontology matching algorithms that are able to find compound mappings between multiple biomedical ontologies, in the form of ternary mappings, finding for instance that """"aortic valve stenosis""""(HP:0001650) is equivalent to the intersection between """"aortic valve""""(FMA:7236) and """"constricted"""" (PATO:0001847). The algorithms take advantage of search space filtering based on partial mappings between ontology pairs, to be able to handle the increased computational demands. The evaluation of the algorithms has shown that they are able to produce meaningful results, with precision in the range of 60-92% for new mappings. The algorithms were also applied to the potential extension of logical definitions of the OBO and the matching of several plant-related ontologies. CONCLUSIONS: This work is a first step towards finding more complex relations between multiple ontologies. The evaluation shows that the results produced are significant and that the algorithms could satisfy specific integration needs."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13326-017-0171-8,""Algorithms",*Biological Ontologies,"Vocabulary, Controlled"",29316968,PMC5761129",,,,,,

One route to achieving this is through the pooling and co-analysis of data from multiple studies. Where this approach is used, transparency of the methodology for data collation and harmonisation is essential to enable appropriate analysis and interpretation of the derived data. In this paper, we describe the acquisition, management and harmonisation of non-accelerometer data in a project to expand the International Children's Accelerometry Database (ICAD). METHOD: Following a consultation process, ICAD partners were requested to share accelerometer data and information on selected behavioural, social, environmental and health-related constructs. All data were collated into a single repository for cataloguing and harmonisation. Harmonised variables were derived iteratively, with input from the ICAD investigators and a panel of invited experts. Extensive documentation, describing the source data and harmonisation procedure, was prepared and made available through the ICAD website. RESULTS: Work to expand ICAD has increased the number of studies with longitudinal accelerometer data, and expanded the breadth of behavioural, social and environmental characteristics that can be used as exposure variables. A set of core harmonised variables, including parent education, ethnicity, school travel mode/duration and car ownership, were derived for use by the research community. Guidance documents and facilities to enable the creation of new harmonised variables were also devised and made available to ICAD users. An expanded ICAD database was made available in May 2017. CONCLUSION: The project to expand ICAD further demonstrates the feasibility of pooling data on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and potential determinants from multiple studies. Key to this process is the rigorous conduct and reporting of retrospective data harmonisation, which is essential to the appropriate analysis and interpretation of derived data. These documents, made available through the ICAD website, may also serve as a guide to others undertaking similar projects."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12966-017-0631-7,""Accelerometry",Adolescent,Child,"Child, Preschool","Databases, Factual",*Exercise,Feasibility Studies,Female,

Ranking of BW scores suggests that participants prioritize collaborative decision-making, assessing understanding and managing expectations, with the least emphasis placed on discussing technological complexities. Stratified analyses found that counselors more experienced with obtaining informed consent for exome sequencing and those reporting higher perceptions of patients' ability to manage information rated discussing variants of uncertain significance as significantly more important (p < .05).

Generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models, can today produce very realistic synthetic images, and can potentially facilitate data sharing. However, in order to share synthetic medical images it must first be demonstrated that they can be used for training different networks with acceptable performance. Here, we therefore comprehensively evaluate four GANs (progressive GAN, StyleGAN 1-3) and a diffusion model for the task of brain tumor segmentation (using two segmentation networks, U-Net and a Swin transformer). Our results show that segmentation networks trained on synthetic images reach Dice scores that are 80%-90% of Dice scores when training with real images, but that memorization of the training images can be a problem for diffusion models if the original dataset is too small.

METHODS: We used high-throughput sequencing to detect differences in the expression profiles of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in PBMCs from patients with SLE at the genome-wide level. Next, we predicted target genes of 30 lincRNAs (long intergenic noncoding RNAs) by constructing a coexpression network of differential lincRNAs and mRNAs and identified the role of lincRNAs. Then, we analyzed the coexpression network of 23 optimized lincRNAs and their corresponding 353 miRNAs, evaluated the cis- and trans-effects of these lincRNAs, and performed GO and KEGG analyses of target genes. We also selected 8 lincRNAs and 2 newly discovered lncRNAs for q-PCR validation and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA analysis. Finally, we also analyzed respectively the relation between lncRNAs and gender bias in SLE patients using RT-qPCR, the relation between Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score and the """"IFN signature"""" using ELISA, and the relation between the differential expression of lncRNAs and a change in the number of a cell type of PBMCs in SLE patients using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The profiles of 1087 lncRNAs, 102 miRNAs, and 4101 mRNAs in PBMCs significantly differed between patients with SLE and healthy controls. The coexpression network analysis showed that the network contained 23 lincRNAs and 353 mRNAs. The evaluation of the cis- and trans-effects showed that the 23 lincRNAs acted on 704 target genes. GO and KEGG analyses of the target genes predicted the biological functions of the 23 lincRNAs. q-PCR validation showed 7 lincRNAs and 2 novel lncRNAs were identical to the sequencing results. The ceRNA network contained 7 validated lincRNAs, 15 miRNAs, and 155 mRNAs. In addition, the differential expression of lncRNAs may be gender dependent in SLE patients, SLE patients also exhibit a robust """"IFN signature,"""" and PBMCs exhibiting differential expression of lncRNAs may be due to a change in the number of a cell type.

Structural variations in the genome have been linked to many complex diseases. Similar to how genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped discover single-nucleotide polymorphisms linked to disease phenotypes, the extension of GWAS to CNVs has aided the discovery of structural variants associated with human traits and diseases. RESULTS: We present CoNVaQ, an easy-to-use web-based tool for CNV-based association studies. The web service allows users to upload two sets of CNV segments and search for genomic regions where the occurrence of CNVs is significantly associated with the phenotype. CoNVaQ provides two models: a simple statistical model using Fisher's exact test and a novel query-based model matching regions to user-defined queries.

In practice, the diversity in appearance of pancreas and organs in abdomen, makes detailed texture information of objects important in segmentation algorithm. According to our observations, however, the structures of previous networks, such as the Richer Feature Convolutional Network (RCF), are too coarse to segment the object (pancreas) accurately, especially the edge. METHOD: In this paper, we extend the RCF, proposed to the field of edge detection, for the challenging pancreas segmentation, and put forward a novel pancreas segmentation network. By employing multi-layer up-sampling structure replacing the simple up-sampling operation in all stages, the proposed network fully considers the multi-scale detailed contexture information of object (pancreas) to perform per-pixel segmentation. Additionally, using the CT scans, we supply and train our network, thus get an effective pipeline. RESULT: Working with our pipeline with multi-layer up-sampling model, we achieve better performance than RCF in the task of single object (pancreas) segmentation. Besides, combining with multi scale input, we achieve the 76.36% DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient) value in testing data.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to identify the preferred sources of health information for caregivers supporting individuals with injuries and to explore how access to this information could be improved. METHODS: A total of 32 caregivers participated in semistructured interviews, which were used in order to develop a more in-depth understanding of these caregivers' information needs.

RESULTS: The caregivers endorsed similar behaviors and preferences when seeking and accessing health information. Medical professionals were the preferred source of information, while ease of access made the Internet the most common avenue to obtain information.

Plain radiography is the first-line imaging modality to diagnose suspected spine disorders. Nevertheless, radiographical appearance is not always sufficient due to highly variable patient and imaging parameters, which can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Employing an accurate automated detection model can alleviate the workload of clinical experts, thereby reducing human errors, facilitating earlier detection, and improving diagnostic accuracy. To this end, deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools have significantly outperformed the accuracy of traditional CAD software. Motivated by these observations, we proposed a deep learning-based approach for end-to-end detection and localization of spine disorders from plain radiographs. In doing so, we took the first steps in employing state-of-the-art transformer networks to differentiate images of multiple spine disorders from healthy counterparts and localize the identified disorders, focusing on vertebral compression fractures (VCF) and spondylolisthesis due to their high prevalence and potential severity. The VCF dataset comprised 337 images, with VCFs collected from 138 subjects and 624 normal images collected from 337 subjects.

Plenty of tools are available as packages that extend the R functionality, and many of them target the analysis of biological networks. Several algorithms for graphs, which are the most adopted mathematical representation of networks, are well-known examples of applications that require high-performance computing, and for which classic sequential implementations are becoming inappropriate. In this context, parallel approaches targeting GPU architectures are becoming pervasive to deal with the execution time constraints.

However, making the decision to screen, or not, for lung cancer is a complex decision because there are potential risks (eg, false positive results, overdiagnosis). Shared decision making was incorporated into the lung cancer screening guideline and, for the first time, is a requirement for reimbursement of a cancer screening test from Medicare. Awareness of lung cancer screening remains low in both the general and screening-eligible populations. When a screening-eligible person visits their clinician never having heard about lung cancer screening, engaging in shared decision making to arrive at an informed decision can be a challenge. Methods to effectively prepare patients for these clinical encounters and support both patients and clinicians to engage in these important discussions are needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the effects of a computer-tailored decision support tool that meets the certification criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards that will prepare individuals and support shared decision making in lung cancer screening decisions. METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled trial with a community-based sample of 60 screening-eligible participants who have never been screened for lung cancer was conducted. Approximately half of the participants (n=31) were randomized to view LungTalk-a web-based tailored computer program-while the other half (n=29) viewed generic information about lung cancer screening from the American Cancer Society. The outcomes that were compared included lung cancer and screening knowledge, lung cancer screening health beliefs (perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy), and perception of being prepared to engage in a discussion about lung cancer screening with their clinician. RESULTS: Knowledge scores increased significantly for both groups with greater improvement noted in the group receiving LungTalk (2.33 vs 1.14 mean change). Perceived self-efficacy and perceived benefits improved in the theoretically expected directions. CONCLUSIONS: LungTalk goes beyond other decision tools by addressing lung health broadly, in the context of performing a low-dose computed tomography of the chest that has the potential to uncover other conditions of concern beyond lung cancer, to more comprehensively educate the individual, and extends the work of nontailored decision aids in the field by introducing tailoring algorithms and message framing based upon smoking status in order to determine what components of the intervention drive behavior change when an individual is informed and makes the decision whether to be screened or not to be screened for lung cancer.

E-consenting was user-friendly, had no identifiable documentation errors as compared to 43.1% (n 47/109) error rate with paper-based consenting, and ensured data safety, and unravelled areas for consideration. Challenges with e-consenting included difficult digitization of ethics stamped documents, as well as present but infrequent delays of retrieval of e-consent forms. CONCLUSION: E-consenting is feasible, has a utility benefit in a controlled human infection study in Malawi"," a low-income country, and can supplement paper-based consenting. Its usefulness can improve the consenting process in research conducted in such settings. Additionally, success of e-consenting requires a careful consideration."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.12688/wellcomeopenres.20770.2,"""",40012986,PMC11862358",,,,,,

Whole-pelvic prostate radiotherapy (WPRT) involves large concave target volumes, which present a challenge for volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) optimization. This study evaluates automated VMAT planning for WPRT-VMAT and compares the results with manual expert planning. METHODS: A system for fully automated multi-criterial plan generation was configured for each step of sequential-boost WPRT-VMAT, with final """"autoVMAT"""" plans being automatically calculated by the Monaco treatment planning system (TPS"," Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Configuration was based on manually generated VMAT plans (manualVMAT) of 5 test patients, the planning protocol, and discussions with the treating physician on wishes for plan improvements. AutoVMAT plans were then generated for another 30 evaluation patients and compared to manualVMAT plans. For all 35 patients, manualVMAT plans were optimized by expert planners using the Monaco TPS. RESULTS: AutoVMAT plans exhibited strongly improved organ sparing and higher conformity compared to manualVMAT. On average, mean doses (D(mean)) of bladder and rectum were reduced by 10.7 and 4.5 Gy, respectively, by autoVMAT. Prostate target coverage (V(95%)) was slightly higher (.6%) with manualVMAT. In a blinded scoring session, the radiation oncologist preferred autoVMAT plans to manualVMAT plans for 27/30 patients. All treatment plans were considered clinically acceptable. The workload per patient was reduced by > 70 min. CONCLUSION: Automated VMAT planning for complex WPRT dose distributions is feasible and creates treatment plans that are generally dosimetrically superior to manually optimized plans."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00066-017-1246-2,""Aged",Algorithms,Humans,Lymphatic Metastasis/radiotherapy,Male,Middle Aged,Organs at Risk/radiation effects,

While computer-assisted planning methods are increasingly gaining importance, the necessary preparation of geometric data based on CT imaging remains largely a manual process. The aim of this work was to develop and test a method for the automated segmentation of the iliac crest for subsequent reconstruction planning. METHODS: A total of 1,398 datasets with manual segmentations were obtained as ground truth, with a subset of 400 datasets used for training and validation of the Neural Networks and another subset of 177 datasets used solely for testing. A deep Convolutional Neural Network implemented in a 3D U-Net architecture using Tensorflow was employed to provide a pipeline for automatic segmentation. Transfer learning was applied for model training optimization. Evaluation metrics included the Dice Similarity Coefficient, Symmetrical Average Surface Distance, and a modified 95% Hausdorff Distance focusing on regions relevant for transplantation. RESULTS: The automated segmentation achieved high accuracy, with qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrating predictions closely aligned with ground truths. Quantitative evaluation of the correspondence yielded values for geometric agreement in the transplant-relevant area of 92%  7% (Dice coefficient) and average surface deviations of 0.605  0.41 mm. In all cases, the bones were identified as contiguous objects in the correct spatial orientation. The geometries of the iliac crests were consistently and completely recognized on both sides without any gaps. CONCLUSIONS: The method was successfully used to extract the individual geometries of the iliac crest from CT data. Thus, it has the potential to serve as an essential starting point in a digitized planning process and to provide data for subsequent surgical planning. The complete automation of this step allows for efficient and reliable preparation of anatomical data for reconstructive surgeries."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41598-024-83031-0,""Humans",*Ilium/surgery/diagnostic imaging/transplantation,*Deep Learning,"*Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods",*Plastic Surgery Procedures/methods,Bone Transplantation/methods,"Neural Networks, Computer","Surgery, Computer-Assisted/methods",

METHODS: A novel method called TEER is proposed for both multi-lingual temporal expression extraction and normalization from various types of narrative clinical texts including clinical data requests, clinical notes, and clinical trial summaries. TEER is characterized as temporal feature summarization, heuristic rule generation, and automatic pattern learning. By representing a temporal expression as a triple <M, A, N>, TEER identifies temporal mentions M, assigns type attributes A to M, and normalizes the values of M into formal representations N. RESULTS: Based on two heterogeneous clinical text datasets: 400 actual clinical requests in English and 1459 clinical discharge summaries in Chinese. TEER was compared with six state-of-the-art baselines.

Accumulating evidences suggest that the interaction patterns between lncRNAs and miRNAs are closely related to relative expression level, forming a titration mechanism. It could provide an effective approach for characteristic feature extraction. In addition, using the coding non-coding co-expression network and sequence data could also help to measure the similarities among miRNAs and lncRNAs. By mathematically analyzing these types of similarities, we come up with two findings that (i) lncRNAs/miRNAs tend to collaboratively interact with miRNAs/lncRNAs of similar expression profiles, and vice versa, and (ii) those miRNAs interacting with a cluster of common target genes tend to jointly target at the common lncRNAs. METHODS: In this work, we developed a novel group preference Bayesian collaborative filtering model called GBCF for picking up a top-k probability ranking list for an individual miRNA or lncRNA based on the known miRNA-lncRNA interaction network. RESULTS: To evaluate the effectiveness of GBCF, leave-one-out and k-fold cross validations as well as a series of comparison experiments were carried out.

Unravelling such disease genes is crucial to fully understand the genetic landscape of diseases on molecular level. With the advent of 'omic' data era, network-based methods have prominently boosted disease gene discovery. However, how to make better use of different types of data for the prediction of disease genes remains a challenge. RESULTS: In this study, we improved the performance of disease gene prediction by integrating the similarity of disease phenotype, biological function and network topology. First, for each phenotype, a phenotype-specific network was specially constructed by mapping phenotype similarity information of given phenotype onto the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, we developed a gene gravity-like algorithm, to score candidate genes based on not only topological similarity but also functional similarity. We tested the proposed network and algorithm by conducting leave-one-out and leave-10%-out cross validation and compared them with state-of-art algorithms. The results showed a preference to phenotype-specific network as well as gene gravity-like algorithm. At last, we tested the predicting capacity of proposed algorithms by test gene set derived from the DisGeNET database. Also, potential disease genes of three polygenic diseases, obesity, prostate cancer and lung cancer, were predicted by proposed methods. We found that the predicted disease genes are highly consistent with literature and database evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The good performance of phenotype-specific networks indicates that phenotype similarity information has positive effect on the prediction of disease genes. The proposed gene gravity-like algorithm outperforms the algorithm of Random Walk with Restart (RWR), implicating its predicting capacity by combing topological similarity with functional similarity.

Recent work has shown that curation and systematic annotation of human phenome data can significantly improve the quality and selectivity for the interpretation of inherited diseases. We have therefore developed PhenoDis, a comprehensive, manually annotated database providing symptomatic, genetic and imprinting information about rare cardiac diseases. RESULTS: PhenoDis includes 214 rare cardiac diseases from Orphanet and 94 more from OMIM. For phenotypic characterization of the diseases, we performed manual annotation of diseases with articles from the biomedical literature. Detailed description of disease symptoms required the use of 2247 different terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Diseases listed in PhenoDis frequently cover a broad spectrum of symptoms with 28% from the branch of 'cardiovascular abnormality' and others from areas such as neurological (11.5%) and metabolism (6%). We collected extensive information on the frequency of symptoms in respective diseases as well as on disease-associated genes and imprinting data. The analysis of the abundance of symptoms in patient studies revealed that most of the annotated symptoms (71%) are found in less than half of the patients of a particular disease. Comprehensive and systematic characterization of symptoms including their frequency is a pivotal prerequisite for computer based prediction of diseases and disease causing genetic variants. To this end, PhenoDis provides in-depth annotation for a complete group of rare diseases, including information on pathogenic and likely pathogenic genetic variants for 206 diseases as listed in ClinVar. We integrated all results in an online database ( http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/phenodis/ ) with multiple search options and provide the complete dataset for download.

In cancer genomics, it is suggested that reconstructing the clonal haplotypes of a tumor sample could facilitate a comprehensive understanding of its clonal architecture and further provide valuable reference in clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, the sequencing data is an admixture of reads sampled from different clonal haplotypes, which complicates the computational problem by exponentially increasing the solution-space and leads the existing algorithms to an unacceptable time-/space- complexity. In addition, the evolutionary process among clonal haplotypes further weakens those algorithms by bringing indistinguishable candidate solutions. RESULTS: To improve the algorithmic performance of phasing clonal haplotypes, in this article, we propose MixSubHap, which is a graph-based computational pipeline working on cancer sequencing data. To reduce the computation complexity, MixSubHap adopts three bounding strategies to limit the solution space and filter out false positive candidates. It first estimates the global clonal structure by clustering the variant allelic frequencies on sampled point mutations. This offers a priori on the number of clonal haplotypes when copy-number variations are not considered. Then, it utilizes a greedy extension algorithm to approximately find the longest linkage of the locally assembled contigs. Finally, it incorporates a read-depth stripping algorithm to filter out false linkages according to the posterior estimation of tumor purity and the estimated percentage of each sub-clone in the sample. A series of experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed pipeline. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that MixSubHap is able to identify about 90% on average of the preset clonal haplotypes under different simulation configurations. Especially, MixSubHap is robust when decreasing the mutation rates, in which cases the longest assembled contig could reach to 10kbps, while the accuracy of assigning a mutation to its haplotype still keeps more than 60% on average. MixSubHap is considered as a practical algorithm to reconstruct clonal haplotypes from cancer sequencing data.

Kernel methods for supervised relation extraction are often preferred over manual feature engineering methods, when classifying highly ordered structures such as trees and graphs obtained from syntactic parsing of a sentence. Tree kernels such as the Subset Tree Kernel and Partial Tree Kernel have been shown to be effective for classifying constituency parse trees and basic dependency parse graphs of a sentence. Graph kernels such as the All Path Graph kernel (APG) and Approximate Subgraph Matching (ASM) kernel have been shown to be suitable for classifying general graphs with cycles, such as the enhanced dependency parse graph of a sentence. In this work, we present a high performance Chemical-Induced Disease (CID) relation extraction system. We present a comparative study of kernel methods for the CID task and also extend our study to the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) extraction task, an important biomedical relation extraction task. We discuss novel modifications to the ASM kernel to boost its performance and a method to apply graph kernels for extracting relations expressed in multiple sentences. RESULTS: Our system for CID relation extraction attains an F-score of 60%, without using external knowledge sources or task specific heuristic or rules. In comparison, the state of the art Chemical-Disease Relation Extraction system achieves an F-score of 56% using an ensemble of multiple machine learning methods, which is then boosted to 61% with a rule based system employing task specific post processing rules. For the CID task, graph kernels outperform tree kernels substantially, and the best performance is obtained with APG kernel that attains an F-score of 60%, followed by the ASM kernel at 57%. The performance difference between the ASM and APG kernels for CID sentence level relation extraction is not significant. In our evaluation of ASM for the PPI task, ASM performed better than APG kernel for the BioInfer dataset, in the Area Under Curve (AUC) measure (74% vs 69%). However, for all the other PPI datasets, namely AIMed, HPRD50, IEPA and LLL, ASM is substantially outperformed by the APG kernel in F-score and AUC measures. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a high performance Chemical Induced Disease relation extraction, without employing external knowledge sources or task specific heuristics. Our work shows that graph kernels are effective in extracting relations that are expressed in multiple sentences. We also show that the graph kernels, namely the ASM and APG kernels, substantially outperform the tree kernels. Among the graph kernels, we showed the ASM kernel as effective for biomedical relation extraction, with comparable performance to the APG kernel for datasets such as the CID-sentence level relation extraction and BioInfer in PPI. Overall, the APG kernel is shown to be significantly more accurate than the ASM kernel, achieving better performance on most datasets."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13326-017-0168-3,*Computer Graphics",Data Mining/*methods,"Protein Interaction Mapping,29382397,PMC5791373",,,,,,

One key emerging platform for research dissemination is social media, including Twitter. While Twitter and other social media are increasingly being used to disseminate research content presented during scientific conferences, few studies have investigated the extent to which these tools are used throughout conferences and how they are being used. The aim for this study was to better understand the use of Twitter during the 2016 Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in Health (D&I conference). METHODS: We performed an analysis of Twitter use before, during, and after the 2016 D&I conference, which took place from December 14 to 15. All tweets (posted between December 1 and 31) that included the conference-specific hashtag (#DIScience16) were assessed. We identified 2639 tweets using the data analytics platform NUVI. We used NUVI software to generate statistics about reach, influence, mentions, and origin of the tweets. Individual tweet content was also assessed using DiscoverText and coded for disease category, implementation outcomes discussed, category of tweet, and conference track. RESULTS: A total of 2639 tweets were analyzed"," 89.1% of the tweets were posted during the conference. A total of 389 unique users participated on Twitter, representing 31 states and 22 locations outside of the USA. Most (56.8%) tweets were re-tweets and were used for scientific promotion (50.6%). Key conference speakers and implementation outcomes (de-implementation, adaptation, and fidelity) were commonly discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that Twitter was used as a platform during the D&I conference, both to facilitate conference discussion and to promote scientific ideas. This work contributes to the existing data analytics and implementation science literature in two major ways: (1) by advancing knowledge of how social media is used during annual academic conferences and (2) by providing a deeper understanding of themes and emerging areas of interest in the dissemination and implementation sciences. Knowing specific topics of interest can help planners and scientists better understand the landscape of current and future implementation research and encourage new research dissemination strategies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13012-018-0723-z,*Congresses as Topic",Consensus,Data Mining,Humans,Information Dissemination,*Internet,Retrospective Studies,"Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics"",32497619,"

Equipping the healthcare workers with digital tools such as mobile applications have the potential to increase access to mental health support in low-resource areas. This study examines the acceptability, appropriateness, barriers, and facilitators to implementing a technology-assisted mental health intervention (mPareshan) delivered by Lady Health Workers (LHWs) in rural Pakistan. METHODS: This is a qualitative study embedded within a larger implementation research trial assessing the feasibility of an mHealth intervention aimed at improving anxiety and depression. 8 focus group discussions and 18 in-depth interviews were conducted. Perceptions were sought before and after intervention from stakeholders comprising of policymakers, LHWs, Lady Health Supervisors (LHSs), and community participants. Data underwent thematic analysis using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: Six main themes emerged from the data. All participants had realization of rising burden of mental illnesses and identified key determinants for mental ill-health. Delivery of mental health counselling by LHWs through a technology-assisted intervention was deemed acceptable and appropriate. LHWs were considered capable and trustworthy by the community to deliver a home-based mHealth intervention, given their easy accessibility as residents of the same community. The technology demonstrated potential for easy adoption as these frontline health workers were already familiar with smartphone technology. Some barriers identified during implementation roll-out included heavy workload of LHWs and difficulty in internet connectivity. Use of videos for counselling, and supportive supervision by LHSs emerged as key facilitators for implementation. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that a technology-focused mental health intervention is feasible, acceptable, and appropriate to be implemented by community frontline workers in resource-constrained rural Pakistani settings. The mPareshan intervention can be easily adopted within the LHW-P. Further research should investigate how implementation barriers can be addressed for successful delivery."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12888-024-06459-8,Humans",Pakistan,*Qualitative Research,Female,Adult,*Community Health Workers,*Telemedicine,*Rural Population,

Computer-based cognitive aids are a valuable tool, especially in education and training of medical professionals. For the management of polytrauma cases, TraumaFlow, a workflow management-based clinical decision support system, was developed. The system supports the registration and coordination of activities in the resuscitation room and actively recommends diagnosis and treatment actions. METHODS: Based on medical guidelines, a resuscitation room algorithm was developed according to the cABCDE scheme. The algorithm was then modeled using the process description language BPMN 2.0 and implemented in a workflow management system. In addition, a web-based user interface that provides assistance functions was developed. An evaluation study was conducted with 11 final-year medical students and three residents to assess the applicability of TraumaFlow in a case-based training scenario. RESULTS: TraumaFlow significantly improved guideline-based decision-making, provided more complete therapy, and reduced treatment errors. The system was shown to be beneficial not only for the education of low- and medium-experienced users but also for the training of highly experienced physicians. 92% of the participants felt more confident with computer-aided decision support and considered TraumaFlow useful for the training of polytrauma treatment. In addition, 62% acknowledged a higher training effect. CONCLUSION: TraumaFlow enables real-time decision support for the treatment of polytrauma patients. It improves guideline-based decision-making in complex and critical situations and reduces treatment errors. Supporting functions, such as the automatic treatment documentation and the calculation of medical scores, enable the trauma team to focus on the primary task. TraumaFlow was developed to support the training of medical students and experienced professionals. Each training session is documented and can be objectively and qualitatively evaluated."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11548-024-03191-2,""Humans",*Workflow,"*Decision Support Systems, Clinical",*Algorithms,Multiple Trauma/therapy,"Emergency Service, Hospital/organization & administration",User-Computer Interface,"Resuscitation/methods/education"",38816648,PMC11607099",

Outbreaks of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections associated with unsafe injection practices, drug diversion, and other exposures to blood are difficult to detect and investigate. Effective HCV outbreak investigation requires comprehensive surveillance and robust case investigation. We previously developed and validated a methodology for the rapid and cost-effective identification of HCV transmission clusters. Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology (GHOST) is a cloud-based system enabling users, regardless of computational expertise, to analyze and visualize transmission clusters in an independent, accurate and reproducible way. RESULTS: We present and explore performance of several GHOST implemented algorithms using next-generation sequencing data experimentally obtained from hypervariable region 1 of genetically related and unrelated HCV strains. GHOST processes data from an entire MiSeq run in approximately 3 h. A panel of seven specimens was used for preparation of six repeats of MiSeq libraries. Testing sequence data from these libraries by GHOST showed a consistent transmission linkage detection, testifying to high reproducibility of the system. Lack of linkage among genetically unrelated HCV strains and constant detection of genetic linkage between HCV strains from known transmission pairs and from follow-up specimens at different levels of MiSeq-read sampling indicate high specificity and sensitivity of GHOST in accurate detection of HCV transmission. CONCLUSIONS: GHOST enables automatic extraction of timely and relevant public health information suitable for guiding effective intervention measures. It is designed as a virtual diagnostic system intended for use in molecular surveillance and outbreak investigations rather than in research. The system produces accurate and reproducible information on HCV transmission clusters for all users, irrespective of their level of bioinformatics expertise. Improvement in molecular detection capacity will contribute to increasing the rate of transmission detection, thus providing opportunity for rapid, accurate and effective response to outbreaks of hepatitis C. Although GHOST was originally developed for hepatitis C surveillance, its modular structure is readily applicable to other infectious diseases. Worldwide availability of GHOST for the detection of HCV transmissions will foster deeper involvement of public health researchers and practitioners in hepatitis C outbreak investigation."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-017-4268-3,Algorithms",*Cloud Computing,Computational Biology/*methods,Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data,*Epidemiological Monitoring,Hepatitis C/*epidemiology,Humans,*Internationality,

High data volume, selective partial curation, delays in access, and publication of data prior to the ability to curate it can result in incomplete curation of published data. Knowing which data sets are incomplete and how incomplete they are remains a challenge. Awareness that a data set may be incomplete is important for proper interpretation, to avoiding flawed hypothesis generation, and can justify further exploration of published literature for additional relevant data. Computational methods to assess data set completeness are needed. One such method is presented here. RESULTS: In this work, a multivariate linear regression model was used to identify genes in the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) Database having incomplete curated gene expression data sets. Starting with 36,655 gene records from ZFIN, data aggregation, cleansing, and filtering reduced the set to 9870 gene records suitable for training and testing the model to predict the number of expression experiments per gene. Feature engineering and selection identified the following predictive variables: the number of journal publications", the number of journal publications already attributed for gene expression annotation, the percent of journal publications already attributed for expression data, the gene symbol," and the number of transgenic constructs associated with each gene. Twenty-five percent of the gene records (2483 genes) were used to train the model. The remaining 7387 genes were used to test the model. One hundred and twenty-two and 165 of the 7387 tested genes were identified as missing expression annotations based on their residuals being outside the model lower or upper 95% confidence interval respectively. The model had precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.71 at the negative 95% confidence interval and precision of 0.76 and recall of 0.73 at the positive 95% confidence interval. CONCLUSIONS: This method can be used to identify data sets that are incompletely curated, as demonstrated using the gene expression data set from ZFIN. This information can help both database resources and data consumers gauge when it may be useful to look further for published data to augment the existing expertly curated information."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2121-6,""Animals","Animals, Genetically Modified",*Data Mining,"*Databases, Genetic",

However, this process is often time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this study, we introduce a novel precision-preferred comprehensive information extraction and selection procedure to enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of evidence selection for TCM practitioners. METHODS: We integrated an established deep learning model (Evi-BERT combined rule-based method) with Boolean logic algorithms and an expanded retrieval strategy to automatically and accurately select potential evidence with minimal human intervention. The selection process is recorded in real-time, allowing researchers to backtrack and verify its accuracy. This innovative approach was tested on ten high-quality, randomly selected systematic reviews of TCM-related topics written in Chinese. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compared the screening time and accuracy of this approach with traditional evidence selection methods. RESULTS: Our finding demonstrated that the new method accurately selected potential literature based on consistent criteria while significantly reducing the time required for the process. Additionally, in some cases, this approach identified a broader range of relevant evidence and enabled the tracking of selection progress for future reference. The study also revealed that traditional screening methods are often subjective and prone to errors, frequently resulting in the inclusion of literature that does not meet established standards. In contrast, our method offers a more accurate and efficient way to select clinical evidence for TCM practitioners, outperforming traditional manual approaches. CONCLUSION: We proposed an innovative approach for selecting clinical evidence for TCM reviews and guidelines, aiming to reduce the workload for researchers. While this method showed promise in improving the efficiency and accuracy of evidence-based selection, its full potential required further validation.

A particular issue is that some patients appear to make heavy use of services, including primary care out of hours. We hypothesised that greater variation (statistical complexity) in reasons for attending primary care out of hours services may be a useful marker of patients at high risk of ongoing heavy service use. METHODS: We analysed an anonymised dataset of contacts with the primary care out of hours care for Scotland in 2011. This contained 120,395 contacts from 13,981 high-using patients who made 5 or more contacts during a calendar year. We allocated the stated reason for each encounter into one of 14 categories. For each patient we calculated measures of statistical complexity of reasons for encounter including the count of different categories, Herfindahl index and statistical entropy of either the categories themselves, or the category transitions. We examined the association of these measures of statistical complexity with patient and healthcare use characteristics. RESULTS: The high users comprised 2.4% of adults using the service and accounted for 15% of all contacts. Statistical complexity (as entropy of categories) increased with number of contacts but was not substantially influenced by either patient age or sex. This lack of association with age was unexpected as with increasing multi-morbidity one would expect greater variability in reason for encounter. Between 5 and 10 consultations, higher entropy was associated with a reduced likelihood of further consultations. In contrast, the occurrence of one or more contacts for a mental health problem was associated with increased likelihood of further consultations. CONCLUSION: Complexity of reason for encounter can be estimated in an out of hours primary care setting. Similar levels of statistical complexity are seen in younger and older adults (suggesting that it is more to do with consultation behaviour than morbidity) but it is not a predictor of ongoing high use of urgent care."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-019-3938-z,""*After-Hours Care",Aged,"Databases, Factual",Female,Humans,Male,*Medical Overuse/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Humans

The ethical boundaries of digital technologies are opaque. The main motivation is to cope with the uncertainties of workplaces' digitization and develop an ethics framework, termed SmartFrameWorK, for personalized health support through ICT tools at workplace environments. SmartFrameWorK is built upon a five-dimensional approach of ethics norms: autonomy, privacy, transparency, trustworthiness and accountability to incite trust in digital workplace technologies. A typology underpins these principles and guides the ethical decision-making process with regard to older worker particular needs, context, data type-related risks and digital tools' use throughout their lifecycle. Risk analysis of pervasive technology use and multimodal data collection, highlighted the imperative for ethically aware practices for older workers' activity and behaviour monitoring. The SmartFrameWorK methodology has been applied in a case study to provide evidence that personalized digital services could elicit trust in users through a well-defined framework.

Due to their significance, bioactive peptides have broad application potential in drug development, food science, and biotechnology. Among them, understanding their biological mechanisms will contribute to new ideas for drug discovery and disease treatment. RESULTS: This study employs generative adversarial capsule networks (CapsuleGAN), gated recurrent units (GRU), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as base classifiers to achieve ensemble learning through voting methods, which not only obtains high-precision prediction results on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides dataset and the anticancer peptides (ACP) dataset but also demonstrates effective model performance. For this method, we first utilized the protein language model-evolutionary scale modeling (ESM-2)-to extract relevant features for the ACE inhibitory peptides and ACP datasets. Following feature extraction, we trained three deep learning models-CapsuleGAN, GRU, and CNN-while continuously adjusting the model parameters throughout the training process. Finally, during the voting stage, different weights were assigned to the models based on their prediction accuracy, allowing full utilization of the model's performance. Experimental results show that on the ACE inhibitory peptide dataset, the balanced accuracy is 0.926, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is 0.831, and the area under the curve is 0.966"," on the ACP dataset, the accuracy (ACC) is 0.779, and the MCC is 0.558. The experimental results on both datasets are superior to existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the experimental approach. CONCLUSION: In this study, CapsuleGAN, GRU, and CNN were successfully employed as base classifiers to implement ensemble learning, which not only achieved good results in the prediction of two datasets but also surpassed existing methods. The ability to predict peptides with strong ACE inhibitory activity and ACPs more accurately and quickly is significant, and this work provides valuable insights for predicting other functional peptides.

The (conformation) space of possible three-dimensional spatial arrangements of the chain of amino acids that constitute a protein molecule is vast and high-dimensional. Exploration of the conformation spaces is performed in a sampling-based manner and is biased by the internal energy that sums atomic interactions. Even state-of-the-art energy functions that quantify such interactions are inherently inaccurate and associate with protein conformation spaces overly rugged energy surfaces riddled with artifact local minima. The response to these challenges in template-free protein structure prediction is to generate large numbers of low-energy conformations (also referred to as decoys) as a way of increasing the likelihood of having a diverse decoy dataset that covers a sufficient number of local minima possibly housing near-native conformations. RESULTS: In this paper we pursue a complementary approach and propose to directly control the diversity of generated decoys. Inspired by hard optimization problems in high-dimensional and non-linear variable spaces, we propose that conformation sampling for decoy generation is more naturally framed as a multi-objective optimization problem. We demonstrate that mechanisms inherent to evolutionary search techniques facilitate such framing and allow balancing multiple objectives in protein conformation sampling. We showcase here an operationalization of this idea via a novel evolutionary algorithm that has high exploration capability and is also able to access lower-energy regions of the energy landscape of a given protein with similar or better proximity to the known native structure than several state-of-the-art decoy generation algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: The presented results constitute a promising research direction in improving decoy generation for template-free protein structure prediction with regards to balancing of multiple conflicting objectives under an optimization framework. Future work will consider additional optimization objectives and variants of improvement and selection operators to apportion a fixed computational budget.

RESULTS: Here we present CoVaCS, a fully automated, highly accurate system with a web based graphical interface for genotyping and variant annotation. Extensive tests on a gold standard benchmark data-set -the NA12878 Illumina platinum genome- confirm that call-sets based on our consensus strategy are completely in line with those attained by similar command line based approaches, and far more accurate than call-sets from any individual tool. Importantly our system exhibits better sensitivity and higher specificity than equivalent commercial software.

To address this deficiency, we developed a survey to provide a snapshot of current sequencing activities globally, identify barriers to data sharing and use this information to develop sustainable solutions for the cancer research community. METHODS: A multi-item survey was conducted assessing demographics, clinical data collection, genomic platforms, privacy/ethics concerns, funding sources and data sharing barriers for sequencing initiatives globally. Additionally, respondents were asked as to provide the primary intent of their initiative (clinical diagnostic, research or combination). RESULTS: Of 107 initiatives invited to participate, 59 responded (response rate = 55%). Whole exome sequencing (P = 0.03) and whole genome sequencing (P = 0.01) were utilized less frequently in clinical diagnostic than in research initiatives. Procedures to identify cancer-specific variants were heterogeneous, with bioinformatics pipelines employing different mutation calling/variant annotation algorithms. Measurement of treatment efficacy varied amongst initiatives, with time on treatment (57%) and RECIST (53%) being the most common"," however, other parameters were also employed. Whilst 72% of initiatives indicated data sharing, its scope varied, with a number of restrictions in place (e.g. transfer of raw data). The largest perceived barriers to data harmonization were the lack of financial support (P < 0.01) and bioinformatics concerns (e.g. lack of interoperability) (P = 0.02). Capturing clinical data was more likely to be perceived as a barrier to data sharing by larger initiatives than by smaller initiatives (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results identify the main barriers, as perceived by the cancer sequencing community, to effective sharing of cancer genomic and clinical data. They highlight the need for greater harmonization of technical, ethical and data capture processes in cancer sample sequencing worldwide, in order to support effective and responsible data sharing for the benefit of patients."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1093/annonc/mdx037,""DNA Mutational Analysis","Databases, Genetic",*Genetic Association Studies,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,"Genome, Human",Humans,Molecular Sequence Annotation,

Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs), such as smartphone applications, wearables, and home-based sensors, can change these periodic subjective assessments to more frequent, or even continuous, objective monitoring. The aim of the RADAR-AD study is to assess the accuracy and validity of RMTs in measuring functional decline in a real-world environment across preclinical-to-moderate stages of AD compared to standard clinical rating scales. METHODS: This study includes three tiers. For the main study, we will include participants (n = 220) with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls, classified by MMSE and CDR score, from clinical sites equally distributed over 13 European countries. Participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological testing and physical examination. The RMT assessments, performed over an 8-week period, include walk tests, financial management tasks, an augmented reality game, two activity trackers, and two smartphone applications installed on the participants' phone. In the first sub-study, fixed sensors will be installed in the homes of a representative sub-sample of 40 participants. In the second sub-study, 10 participants will stay in a smart home for 1 week. The primary outcome of this study is the difference in functional domain profiles assessed using RMTs between the four study groups. The four participant groups will be compared for each RMT outcome measure separately. Each RMT outcome will be compared to a standard clinical test which measures the same functional or cognitive domain. Finally, multivariate prediction models will be developed. Data collection and privacy are important aspects of the project, which will be managed using the RADAR-base data platform running on specifically designed biomedical research computing infrastructure. RESULTS: First results are expected to be disseminated in 2022. CONCLUSION: Our study is well placed to evaluate the clinical utility of RMT assessments. Leveraging modern-day technology may deliver new and improved methods for accurately monitoring functional decline in all stages of AD. It is greatly anticipated that these methods could lead to objective and real-life functional endpoints with increased sensitivity to pharmacological agent signal detection."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13195-021-00825-4,*Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis",Caregivers,Europe,Humans,Neuropsychological Tests,"Technology,33892789,PMC8063580",,,

As many as 40% of patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness are reported to be infected with more than one type of virus. However, it is not clear whether these infections are more severe than single viral infections. Mathematical models can be used to help us understand the dynamics of respiratory viral coinfections and their impact on the severity of the illness. Most models of viral infections use ordinary differential equations (ODE) that reproduce the average behavior of the infection, however, they might be inaccurate in predicting certain events because of the stochastic nature of viral replication cycle. Stochastic simulations of single virus infections have shown that there is an extinction probability that depends on the size of the initial viral inoculum and parameters that describe virus-cell interactions. Thus the coinfection dynamics predicted by the ODE might be difficult to observe in reality. RESULTS: In this work, a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model is formulated to investigate probabilistic outcomes of coinfections. This CTMC model is based on our previous coinfection model, expressed in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations. Using the Gillespie method for stochastic simulation, we examine whether stochastic effects early in the infection can alter which virus dominates the infection. CONCLUSIONS: We derive extinction probabilities for each virus individually as well as for the infection as a whole. We find that unlike the prediction of the ODE model, for similar initial growth rates stochasticity allows for a slower growing virus to out-compete a faster growing virus."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-019-2793-6,""*Coinfection",Computational Biology,Computer Simulation,Humans,"*Models, Biological","*Models, Statistical",*Respiratory Tract Infections/complications/virology,Stochastic Processes,*COVID-19/epidemiology/virology/mortality

Such innovation provides a great opportunity to decode phenotypic consequences of genetic variation via the construction of predictive gene regulatory network models. However, there still lacks a computational method to systematically integrate chromatin accessibility information with gene expression data to recover complicated regulatory relationships between genes in a tissue-specific manner. RESULTS: We propose a Markov random field (MRF) model for constructing tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory networks via integrative analysis of DNase-seq and RNA-seq data. Our method, named CSNets (cell-line specific regulatory networks), first infers regulatory networks for individual cell lines using chromatin accessibility information, and then fine-tunes these networks using the MRF based on pairwise similarity between cell lines derived from gene expression data. Using this method, we constructed regulatory networks specific to 110 human cell lines and 13 major tissues with the use of ENCODE data. We demonstrated the high quality of these networks via comprehensive statistical analysis based on ChIP-seq profiles, functional annotations, taxonomic analysis, and literature surveys. We further applied these networks to analyze GWAS data of Crohn's disease and prostate cancer. Results were either consistent with the literature or provided biological insights into regulatory mechanisms of these two complex diseases.

ACQUISITION AND VALIDATION METHODS: The library was developed under local ethics committee approval. Projection and image data from 299 clinically performed patient CT exams were archived for three types of clinical exams: noncontrast head CT scans acquired for acute cognitive or motor deficit, low-dose noncontrast chest scans acquired to screen high-risk patients for pulmonary nodules, and contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen acquired to look for metastatic liver lesions. Scans were performed on CT systems from two different CT manufacturers using routine clinical protocols. Projection data were validated by reconstructing the data using several different reconstruction algorithms and through use of the data in the 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Reduced dose projection data were simulated for each scan using a validated noise-insertion method. Radiologists marked location and diagnosis for detected pathologies. Reference truth was obtained from the patient medical record, either from histology or subsequent imaging. DATA FORMAT AND USAGE NOTES: Projection datasets were converted into the previously developed DICOM-CT-PD format, which is an extended DICOM format created to store CT projections and acquisition geometry in a nonproprietary format. Image data are stored in the standard DICOM image format and clinical data in a spreadsheet. Materials are provided to help investigators use the DICOM-CT-PD files, including a dictionary file, data reader, and user manual.

Understanding the degree to which we can infer disease relationships from molecular data alone may yield insights into how to ultimately construct more modern taxonomies that integrate both physiological and molecular information. RESULTS: We introduce a new technique we call Parent Promotion to infer hierarchical relationships between disease terms using disease-gene data. We compare this technique with both an established ontology inference method (CliXO) and a minimum weight spanning tree approach. Because there is no gold standard molecular disease taxonomy available, we compare our inferred hierarchies to both the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) category C forest of diseases and to subnetworks of the Disease Ontology (DO). This comparison provides insights about the inference algorithms, choices of evaluation metrics, and the existing molecular content of various subnetworks of MeSH and the DO. Our results suggest that the Parent Promotion method performs well in most cases. Performance across MeSH trees is also correlated between inference methods. Specifically, inferred relationships are more consistent with those in smaller MeSH disease trees than larger ones, but there are some notable exceptions that may correlate with higher molecular content in MeSH. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments provide insights about learning relationships between diseases from disease genes alone. Future work should explore the prospect of disease term discovery from molecular data and how best to integrate molecular data with anatomical and clinical knowledge. This study nonetheless suggests that disease gene information has the potential to form an important part of the foundation for future representations of the disease landscape."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13326-017-0134-0,*Biological Ontologies",Disease/*genetics,Humans,Medical Subject Headings,"Reproducibility of Results,28750648,PMC5530939",,,,

The net utility of medication-supported digital weight-loss services (DWLSs) has been intensely debated over the past few years due to their rapid uptake against the backdrop of the obesity epidemic. However, research on these services in real-world settings is scarce. Patients of a large multinational DWLS were emailed a four-question survey, soliciting their reasons for using the service instead of face-to-face (F2F) alternatives. Responses were collected from 1,283 patients, including 481 from the United Kingdom, 428 from Germany, and 374 from Australia. Personal discomfort in discussing weight loss in F2F settings was the most common reason for subscribing to the Eucalyptus DWLS across the full cohort (N = 557, 43.41%), followed by the modality's flexibility (N = 441, 34.37%), patient inability to access comprehensive obesity care through a local general practitioner (GP) (N = 435, 33.90%), and marketing or brand awareness (N = 358, 27.90%). Several significant differences were observed between country, gender, ethnicity, and regular GP status across each of the subscription reasons. This study contributed another important layer to the emerging literature on DWLSs by generating preliminary quantitative evidence of their benefits to obesity care access. However, the findings also indicated that a certain number of patients may be subscribing to such services simply to access weight-loss medications rather than multidisciplinary care.

METHODS: A mixed method pilot comparative study was conducted in primary care. Practices were allocated to an electronic form (e-form) group or a paper-based form (p-form) group. Allocation was randomly assigned for the first practice then by alternation. Patients in the e-form practices completed forms at home via the web or in the waiting room on a tablet.

A bias analysis quantitatively assesses how conclusions change under different assumptions about missingness using bias parameters that govern the magnitude and direction of the bias. Probabilistic bias analysis specifies a prior distribution for these parameters, explicitly incorporating available information and uncertainty about their true values. A Bayesian bias analysis combines the prior distribution with the data's likelihood function whilst a Monte Carlo bias analysis samples the bias parameters directly from the prior distribution. No study has compared a Monte Carlo bias analysis to a Bayesian bias analysis in the context of MNAR missingness. METHODS: We illustrate an accessible probabilistic bias analysis using the Monte Carlo bias analysis approach and a well-known imputation method. We designed a simulation study based on a motivating example from the UK Biobank study, where a large proportion of the outcome was missing and missingness was suspected to be MNAR. We compared the performance of our Monte Carlo bias analysis to a principled Bayesian bias analysis, complete case analysis (CCA) and multiple imputation (MI) assuming missing at random. RESULTS: As expected, given the simulation study design, CCA and MI estimates were substantially biased, with 95% confidence interval coverages of 7-48%. Including auxiliary variables (i.e., variables not included in the substantive analysis that are predictive of missingness and the missing data) in MI's imputation model amplified the bias due to assuming missing at random. With reasonably accurate and precise information about the bias parameter, the Monte Carlo bias analysis performed as well as the Bayesian bias analysis. However, when very limited information was provided about the bias parameter, only the Bayesian bias analysis was able to eliminate most of the bias due to MNAR whilst the Monte Carlo bias analysis performed no better than the CCA and MI. CONCLUSION: The Monte Carlo bias analysis we describe is easy to implement in standard software and, in the setting we explored, is a viable alternative to a Bayesian bias analysis. We caution careful consideration of choice of auxiliary variables when applying imputation where data may be MNAR."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-024-02382-4,""Humans",*Monte Carlo Method,*Bayes Theorem,*Bias,*Computer Simulation,"Data Interpretation, Statistical",Probability,"Models, Statistical",

There are a large number of excellent graph clustering methods that work very well for identifying PCs. However, most of existing methods usually overlook the inherent core-attachment organization of PCs. Therefore, these methods have three major limitations we should concern. Firstly, many methods have ignored the importance of selecting seed, especially without considering the impact of overlapping nodes as seed nodes. Thus, there may be false predictions. Secondly, PCs are generally supposed to be dense subgraphs. However, the subgraphs with high local modularity structure usually correspond to PCs. Thirdly, a number of available methods lack handling noise mechanism, and miss some peripheral proteins. In summary, all these challenging issues are very important for predicting more biological overlapping PCs. RESULTS: In this paper, to overcome these weaknesses, we propose a clustering method by core-attachment and local modularity structure, named CALM, to detect overlapping PCs from weighted PPINs with noises. Firstly, we identify overlapping nodes and seed nodes. Secondly, for a node, we calculate the support function between a node and a cluster. In CALM, a cluster which initially consists of only a seed node, is extended by adding its direct neighboring nodes recursively according to the support function, until this cluster forms a locally optimal modularity subgraph. Thirdly, we repeat this process for the remaining seed nodes. Finally, merging and removing procedures are carried out to obtain final predicted clusters. The experimental results show that CALM outperforms other classical methods, and achieves ideal overall performance. Furthermore, CALM can match more complexes with a higher accuracy and provide a better one-to-one mapping with reference complexes in all test datasets. Additionally, CALM is robust against the high rate of noise PPIN. CONCLUSIONS: By considering core-attachment and local modularity structure, CALM could detect PCs much more effectively than some representative methods. In short, CALM could potentially identify previous undiscovered overlapping PCs with various density and high modularity."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2309-9,""*Algorithms",Cluster Analysis,"Databases, Protein",Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods,Protein Interaction Maps,"Proteins/chemistry"",30134824,PMC6106838",,,

Due to the time and effort required in wet lab experiments, computational prediction of binding affinity from sequence or structure is an important area of research. Structure-based methods, though more accurate than sequence-based techniques, are limited in their applicability due to limited availability of protein structure data. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel machine learning method for predicting binding affinity that uses protein 3D structure as privileged information at training time while expecting only protein sequence information during testing. Using the method, which is based on the framework of learning using privileged information (LUPI), we have achieved improved performance over corresponding sequence-based binding affinity prediction methods that do not have access to privileged information during training. Our experiments show that with the proposed framework which uses structure only during training, it is possible to achieve classification performance comparable to that which is obtained using structure-based features. Evaluation on an independent test set shows improved performance over the PPA-Pred2 method as well. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method outperforms several baseline learners and a state-of-the-art binding affinity predictor not only in cross-validation, but also on an additional validation dataset, demonstrating the utility of the LUPI framework for problems that would benefit from classification using structure-based features. The implementation of LUPI developed for this work is expected to be useful in other areas of bioinformatics as well."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2448-z,*Algorithms",Amino Acid Sequence,Computational Biology/*methods,Ligands,*Machine Learning,Protein Binding,Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism,ROC Curve,

Practical aspects, such as information exchange and coordination, remain challenging. We investigated whether a computerized decision support system (CDSS) could increase treatment adherence and improve clinical outcomes and interprofessional collaboration. METHOD: In this feasibility study, a core team developed the initial treatment process and adapted it based on several discussions with clinical experts and information technologists. The CDSS followed the Basel Decubitus Approach and was used in a clinic specializing in SCI. Thirty patients with SCI admitted for stage III/IV PI between July 2016 and May 2017 were randomly allocated to standard or CDSS-supported care. Between-group differences in treatment adherence, complication rates, length of stay, and costs were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The use of the CDSS and potential barriers and facilitators were evaluated through interprofessional focus groups, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed (30 participants). RESULTS: No differences in SCI characteristics, comorbidities, or PI characteristics (localization: ischium [number (n) = 19 PI, 63%], sacrum [n = 10 PI, 33%], recurrent PI [n = 21, 70%]) were found between the two groups. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were observed in treatment adherence, frequency of major (20% vs. 13% between CDSS and control group) and minor (33% vs 27%) complications, and length of stay (98 [±28] vs 81 [±23] days). Healthcare professionals found the CDSS to be helpful for visualizing the treatment process. However, the high workload and difficulties in the information technology processes, such as missing reminders, slow computer performance and data processing, and poor accessibility, hindered the effective implementation of the CDSS. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the CDSS to support the treatment of stage III/IV PI in patients with SCI was feasible and included definitions of milestones, interventions, and outcomes. However, to assess the impact of the CDSS, a longer observation period is required. Further, the technical difficulties must be addressed, and solid integration of the CDSS into the clinical information system is necessary.

Before practically applying such pathway analysis (PA) methods, we must first evaluate their performance and reliability, using datasets where the pathways perturbed by the conditions of interest have been well characterized in advance. However, such 'ground truths' (or gold standards) are often unavailable. Furthermore, previous evaluation strategies that have focused on defining 'true answers' are unable to systematically and objectively assess PA methods under a wide range of conditions. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a novel strategy for evaluating PA methods independently of any gold standard, either established or assumed. The strategy involves the use of two mutually complementary metrics, recall and discrimination. Recall measures the consistency of the perturbed pathways identified by applying a particular analysis method to an original large dataset and those identified by the same method to a sub-dataset of the original dataset. In contrast, discrimination measures specificity-the degree to which the perturbed pathways identified by a particular method to a dataset from one experiment differ from those identifying by the same method to a dataset from a different experiment. We used these metrics and 24 datasets to evaluate six widely used PA methods. The results highlighted the common challenge in reliably identifying significant pathways from small datasets. Importantly, we confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed dual-metric strategy by showing that previous comparative studies corroborate the performance evaluations of the six methods obtained by our strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike any previously proposed strategy for evaluating the performance of PA methods, our dual-metric strategy does not rely on any ground truth, either established or assumed, of the pathways perturbed by a specific clinical or experimental condition. As such, our strategy allows researchers to systematically and objectively evaluate pathway analysis methods by employing any number of datasets for a variety of conditions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-017-1866-7,""Databases, Genetic

A reason for engaging community members is to co-design services that are locally-appropriate and harness local assets. To date, much literature examines processes of involving participants, with little consideration of innovative services are designed, how innovations emerge, develop and whether they sustain or diffuse. This paper addresses this gap by examining co-designed initiatives through the lens of social innovation - a conceptualisation more attuned to analysing grassroots innovation than common health services research approaches considering top-down, technical innovations. This paper considers whether social innovation is a useful frame for examining co-designed services. METHODS: Eighty-eight volunteer community-based participants from six rural Australian communities were engaged using the same, tested co-design framework for a 12-month design and then 12-month implementation phase, in 24 workshops (2014-16). Mixed, qualitative data were collected and used to formulate five case studies of community co-designed innovations. A social innovation theory, derived from literature, was applied as an analytical frame to examine co-design cases at 3 stages: innovation growth, development and sustainability/diffusion. RESULTS: Social innovation theory was found relevant in examining and understanding what occurred at each stage of innovation development. Innovations themselves were all adaptations of existing ideas. They emerged due to local participants combining knowledge from local context, own experiences and exemplars. External facilitation brought resources together. The project provided a protective niche in which pilot innovations developed, but they needed support from managers and/or policymakers to be implemented"," and to be compatible with existing health system practices. For innovations to move to sustainability/diffusion required political relationships. Challenging existing practice without these was problematical. CONCLUSIONS: Social innovation provides a useful lens to understand the grassroots innovation process implied in community participation in service co-design. It helps to show problems in co-design processes and highlights the need for strong partnerships and advocacy beyond the immediate community for new ideas to thrive. Regional commissioning organisations are intended to diffuse useful, co-designed service innovations. Efforts are required to develop an innovation system to realise the potential of community involvement in co-design."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-2852-0,Australia/epidemiology",*Community Participation,Community-Based Participatory Research,*Education,Health Services Research,Humans,*Oral Hygiene/education,

Drug overdose surveillance typically relies on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) coding system, however its real world utilisation and the implications for surveillance have not been well characterised. This study examines the patterns of ICD-10 coding pertaining to drug overdoses within emergency departments for a cohort of known PWID. METHODS: Cohort data from 688 PWID was linked to statewide emergency department administrative data between January 2008 and June 2013. ICD-10 diagnostic codes pertaining to poisonings by drugs, medicaments and biological substances (T-codes T36-T50) as well as mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F-codes F10-F19) were examined. RESULTS: There were 449 unique ED presentations with T or F code mentions contributed by 168 individuals. Nearly half of the T and F codes used were non-specific and did not identify either a drug class (n = 160, 36%) or clinical reaction (n = 46, 10%) and 8% represented withdrawal states. T and F codes could therefore be used to reasonably infer an illicit drug overdose in only 42% (n = 188) of cases. Majority of presentations with T or F overdose codes recorded only one diagnostic code per encounter (83%) and representing multiple-drug overdose (F19.- = 18%) or unidentified substances (T50.9 = 17%) using a single, broad diagnostic code was common. CONCLUSIONS: Reliance on diagnoses alone when examining ED data will likely significantly underestimate incidence of specific drug overdose due to frequent use of non-specific ICD-10 codes and the use of single diagnostic codes to represent polysubstance overdose. Measures to improve coding specificity should be considered and further work is needed to determine the best way to use ED data in overdose surveillance."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-3756-8,""Adolescent",Adult,Cohort Studies,Drug Overdose/*classification/diagnosis/epidemiology,"*Emergency Service, Hospital",Female,Humans,Incidence,

This study exploits the newly created UK medical education database (UKMED), with the aim of identifying predictors of conduct or health-related issues that could potentially impair FtP. The findings would have implications for policies related to both the selection and support of medical students. METHODS: Data were available for 14,379 students obtaining provisional registration with the General Medical Council who started medical school in 2007 and 2008. FtP declarations made by students were available, as were various educational and demographic predictor variables, including self-report 'personality measures' for students who participated in UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT) pilot studies. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the predictors of FtP declarations. RESULTS: Significant univariable predictors (p < 0.05) for conduct-related declarations included male gender, white ethnicity and a non-professional parental background. Male gender (OR 3.07) and higher 'self-esteem' (OR 1.45) were independently associated with an increased risk of a conduct issue. Female gender, a non-professional background, and lower self-reported 'confidence' were, among others, associated with increased odds of a health-related declaration. Only 'confidence' was a significant independent predictor of a health declaration (OR 0.69). Female gender, higher UKCAT score, a non-professional background and lower 'confidence' scores were significant predictors of reported depression, and the latter two variables were independent predictors of declared depression. CONCLUSIONS: White ethnicity and UK nationality were associated with increased odds of both conduct and health-related declarations, as were certain personality traits. Students from non-professional backgrounds may be at increased risk of depression and therefore could benefit from targeted support. The small effect sizes observed for the 'personality measures' suggest they would offer little potential benefit for selection, over and above those measures already in use."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12909-018-1167-5,""Analysis of Variance",*Clinical Competence,"Databases, Factual","*Education, Medical, Undergraduate",Educational Status,Female,Forecasting,Humans,Uganda

The objective of this study was to develop a model to predict requirement for hemodynamic intervention in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)"," thus, clinicians can direct their care to patients likely to benefit from interventions to prevent further deterioration. METHODS: The model proposed in this study was trained on a retrospective cohort of all patients admitted to a tertiary PICU at a single center in the United States, and validated on another retrospective cohort of all patients admitted to the PICU at a single center in the United Kingdom. The PICU clinical information system database (Intellivue Clinical Information Portfolio, Philips, UK) was interrogated to collect physiological and laboratory data. The model was trained using a variant of AdaBoost, which learned a set of low-dimensional classifiers, each of which was age adjusted. RESULTS: A total of 7052 patients admitted to the US PICU was used for training the model, and a total of 970 patients admitted to the UK PICU was used for validation. On the training/validation datasets, the model showed better prediction of hemodynamic intervention (area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) = 0.81/0.81) than systolic blood pressure-based (AUCROC = 0.58/0.67) or shock index-based (AUCROC = 0.63/0.65) models. Both of these models were age adjusted using the same classifier. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model reliably predicted the need for hemodynamic intervention in PICU patients and provides better classification performance when compared to systolic blood pressure-based or shock index-based models alone.

Findings reveal nuanced relationships between techno competence, teacher support, self-efficacy, autonomy, and test anxiety, highlighting the pivotal role of these factors in shaping students' experiences and outcomes. Learners with high techno competence demonstrate greater confidence in navigating online assessment platforms and employ adaptive coping strategies to manage test anxiety effectively. Conversely, those with low techno competence may experience heightened anxiety due to technical challenges and a lack of confidence in their digital skills. Perceived teacher support emerges as a crucial determinant in mitigating test anxiety, with supportive and nurturing relationships fostering a sense of security and confidence among learners. Additionally, self-efficacy and autonomy play significant mediating roles, influencing students' perceptions of their capabilities and their ability to regulate their learning processes.

To ground this debate in data, it would be helpful to have a corpus of experimentally-verified cases of genes which have functionally distinct splice isoforms (FDSIs). RESULTS: We established a curation framework for evaluating experimental evidence of FDSIs, and analyzed over 700 human and mouse genes, strongly biased towards genes that are prominent in the alternative splicing literature. Despite this bias, we found experimental evidence meeting the classical definition for functionally distinct isoforms for ~ 5% of the curated genes. If we relax our criteria for inclusion to include weaker forms of evidence, the fraction of genes with evidence of FDSIs remains low (~ 13%). We provide evidence that this picture will not change substantially with further curation and conclude there is a large gap between the presumed impact of splicing on gene function and the experimental evidence. Furthermore, many functionally distinct isoforms were not traceable to a specific isoform in Ensembl, a database that forms the basis for much computational research. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the claim that alternative splicing vastly increases the functional repertoire of the genome is an extrapolation from a limited number of empirically supported cases. We also conclude that more work is needed to integrate experimental evidence and genome annotation databases. Our work should help shape research around the role of splicing on gene function from presuming large general effects to acknowledging the need for stronger experimental evidence."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-018-5013-2,*Alternative Splicing",Animals,*Computational Biology,Humans,Mice,"Protein Isoforms/*genetics,30153812,PMC6114036",,,"Aged, 80 and over"

Individual studies on gene expression in ASD cannot provide clear consensus conclusions. Therefore, a systematic review to synthesize the current findings from brain tissues and a search tool to share the meta-analysis results are urgently needed. METHODS: Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of brain gene expression profiles in the current reported human ASD expression datasets (with 84 frozen male cortex samples, 17 female cortex samples, 32 cerebellum samples and 4 formalin fixed samples) and knock-out mouse ASD model expression datasets (with 80 collective brain samples). Then, we applied R language software and developed an interactive shared and updated database (dbMDEGA) displaying the results of meta-analysis of data from ASD studies regarding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain. RESULTS: This database, dbMDEGA ( https://dbmdega.shinyapps.io/dbMDEGA/ ), is a publicly available web-portal for manual annotation and visualization of DEGs in the brain from data from ASD studies. This database uniquely presents meta-analysis values and homologous forest plots of DEGs in brain tissues. Gene entries are annotated with meta-values, statistical values and forest plots of DEGs in brain samples. This database aims to provide searchable meta-analysis results based on the current reported brain gene expression datasets of ASD to help detect candidate genes underlying this disorder. CONCLUSION: This new analytical tool may provide valuable assistance in the discovery of DEGs and the elucidation of the molecular pathogenicity of ASD.

Detecting changes in prescribing behaviour compared with peers can help identify missed opportunities for medicines optimisation. Automating the process of detecting these changes is necessary due to the volume of data, but challenging due to variation in prescribing volume for different measures and locations. We set out to develop and implement a method of detecting change on all individual prescribing measures, in order to notify CCGs and practices of such changes in a timely manner. METHODS: We used the statistical process control method CUSUM to detect prescribing behaviour changes in relation to population trends for the individual standard measures on OpenPrescribing. Increases and decreases in percentile were detected separately, using a multiple of standard deviation as the threshold for detecting change. The algorithm was modified to continue re-triggering when trajectory persists. It was deployed, user-tested, and summary statistics generated on the number of alerts by CCG and practice. RESULTS: The algorithm detected changes in prescribing for 32 prespecified measures, across a wide range of CCG and practice sizes. Across the 209 English CCGs, a mean of 2.5 increase and 2.4 decrease alerts were triggered per CCG, per month. For the 7578 practices, a mean of 1.3 increase and 1.4 decrease alerts were triggered per practice, per month. CONCLUSIONS: The CUSUM method appears to effectively discriminate between random noise and sustained change in prescribing behaviour. This method aims to allow practices and CCGs to be informed of important changes quickly, with a view to improve their prescribing behaviour. The number of alerts triggered for CCGs and practices appears to be appropriate. Prescribing behaviour after users are alerted to changes will be monitored in order to assess the impact of these alerts."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-018-0642-6,""*Algorithms",Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data,Humans,Medical Order Entry Systems/*statistics & numerical data,National Health Programs/*statistics & numerical data,Peer Group,"Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data","United Kingdom"",29986693,PMC6038291",

Nevertheless, PDs are commonly prescribed to reduce NPS. A smartphone application that evaluates appropriateness of PD prescriptions and provides recommendations from the revised Dutch guideline on problem behaviour in dementia may promote guideline adherence and increase appropriate prescribing. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess user experiences, barriers and facilitators of the Dutch 'Psychotropic Drug Tool' smartphone application (PDT) in the context of appropriate prescribing of PDs to nursing home residents with dementia and NPS. METHODS/DESIGN: The PDT was developed according to the recommendations of the Dutch guideline for treatment of NPS in people with dementia. Feedback provided during usability testing with two end-users was applied to improve the PDT before implementation in day-to-day practice. Sixty-three prescribers were asked to use the PDT at their own convenience for four months. User expectations and experiences were assessed at baseline and after four months with the System Usability Scale and the Assessment of Barriers and Facilitators for Implementation. RESULTS: Expected usability (M = 72.59", SD = 11.84) was similar to experienced usability after four months (M = 69.13," SD = 16.48). Appreciation of the PDTs user-friendliness (on average 6.7 out of 10) and design (7.3) were moderately positive, in contrast to the global rating of the PDT (5.7). Perceived barriers for PDT use were time consumption and lack of integration with existing electronic systems. Perceived facilitators were ease of use and attractive lay out. For broader implementation, physicians suggested a change in direction of the PDT: start assessment of appropriateness based on the list of NPS instead of PD as primary input. CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic prospective cohort study we found that the PDT was used by elderly care physicians, with mediocre user satisfaction. The PDT will be optimized based on user feedback regarding experienced usability, barriers and facilitators, after which broader implementation can be initialized.

The aim of this study is to test in practice a recently developed MCDA methodological framework known as Advance Value Framework (AVF) through a proof-of-concept case study engaging multiple stakeholders. METHODS: A multi-attribute value theory methodological process was adopted involving problem structuring, model building, model assessment and model appraisal phases. A facilitated decision analysis modelling approach was used as part of a decision conference with thirteen participants. An expanded scope of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) remit acted as the study setting with the use of supplementary value concerns. Second-line biological treatments were evaluated for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients having received prior chemotherapy, including cetuximab monotherapy, panitumumab monotherapy and aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Initially 18 criteria attributes were considered spanning four value domains relating to therapeutic impact, safety profile, innovation level and socioeconomic impact. RESULTS: Nine criteria attributes were finally included. Cetuximab scored the highest overall weighted preference value score of 45.7 out of 100, followed by panitumumab with 42.3, and aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with 14.4. The relative weights of the two most important criteria (overall survival and Grade 4 adverse events) added up to more than the relative weight of all other criteria together (52.1%). Main methodological limitation was the lack of comparative clinical effects across treatments and challenges included the selection of """"lower"""" and """"higher"""" reference levels on criteria attributes, eliciting preferences across attributes where participants had less experience, and ensuring that all attributes possess the right decision theory properties. CONCLUSIONS: This first application of AVF produced transparent rankings for three mCRC treatments based on their value, by assessing an explicit set of evaluation criteria while allowing for the elicitation and construction of participants' value preferences and their trade-offs.

We explore barriers and facilitators to implementing a childhood pneumonia management program in a North Indian district. The study aims to inform the development of effective implementation strategies for pneumonia management in resource-constrained settings. METHODS: This mixed-method study was conducted during the formative phase of an ongoing pre-post quasi-experimental implementation study. Data collection followed the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, encompassing surveys on implementation climate and attitudes toward evidence-based-treatment for childhood pneumonia, as well as in-depth interviews to uncover implementation barriers and facilitators with healthcare staff. Additionally, a baseline cross-sectional facility inventory survey was conducted in 26 government healthcare facilities. We present descriptive statistics from the surveys along with deductive analysis findings from qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Several barriers were observed, like deficient infrastructure and limited space, privacy concerns, inadequate examination tables, disrupted medicine supply, non-maintenance of under-five children's records, inadequate utilization of the digital portal for pneumonia case registration, lack of specific budget allocation for medicine procurement, absence of functional equipment, staff shortages, lack of training, referral linkage issues, and limited accessibility to guideline materials. The absence of incentives demotivated community healthcare workers (CHWs), while coordination issues, power dynamics, and unclear job responsibilities affected the motivation of other healthcare staff. Community reluctance to seek care from government facilities and diminishing community-level trust in CHWs posed implementation challenges. Facilitators included committed healthcare and community workers, problem-solving skills, community engagement, and untied funds from the district government. Implementation climate scores were mildly positive, yet provider attitudes towards Evidence-Based Practices Adoption were neutral.

RESULTS: The proportion of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing major resection did not change after the introduction of surgeon specific public outcome reporting (39 792/62 854 (63.3%) before versus 30 706/48 577 (63.2%) after", P=0.8). The proportion of these major resections categorised as elective or scheduled also did not change (33 638/39 792 (84.5%) before versus 25 905/30 706 (84.4%) after, P=0.5). The predicted 90 day mortality remained the same (2.7% v 2.7%," P=0.3), but the observed 90 day mortality fell (952/33 638 (2.8%) v 552/25 905 (2.1%)). Change point analysis showed that this reduction was over and above the existing downward trend in mortality before the introduction of public outcome reporting (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find evidence that the introduction of public reporting of surgeon specific 90 day postoperative mortality in elective colorectal cancer surgery has led to risk averse clinical practice behaviour or """"gaming"""" of data. However, its introduction coincided with a significant reduction in 90 day mortality."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmj.k1581,""Access to Information/*ethics",Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/*mortality/*surgery,"Databases, Factual",England/epidemiology,

However, it may become impracticable in some contexts due to its high computational demands. Consequently, the computer science community has focused on the use of modern parallel architectures such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Xeon Phi accelerators and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FGPAs) to speed up large-scale workloads. RESULTS: This paper presents and evaluates SWIFOLD: a Smith-Waterman parallel Implementation on FPGA with OpenCL for Long DNA sequences. First, we evaluate its performance and resource usage for different kernel configurations. Next, we carry out a performance comparison between our tool and other state-of-the-art implementations considering three different datasets. SWIFOLD offers the best average performance for small and medium test sets, achieving a performance that is independent of input size and sequence similarity. In addition, SWIFOLD provides competitive performance rates in comparison with GPU-based implementations on the latest GPU generation for the large dataset. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that SWIFOLD can be a serious contender for accelerating the SW alignment of DNA sequences of unrestricted size in an affordable way reaching on average 125 GCUPS and almost a peak of 270 GCUPS."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12918-018-0614-6,*Algorithms",*Base Sequence,Computational Biology,DNA/chemistry,Sequence Alignment/*methods,"*Software,30458766,PMC6245597",,,"United Kingdom/epidemiology"",29636024,PMC5894169"

It has been argued that the specific feature of observing patients in nursing is the stereoscopic vision that allows nurses to see the patient at the same time as a subject and a body. However, with the increased use of technology in nursing and the focus on quantifiable biomedical data, some commentators see a shift from the view of the patient as subject to the patient as body, which results in a de-humanisation and objectification of patients. The new digital technologies in patient monitoring and surveillance add a further dimension to this topic. It is yet unclear how digital technologies affect the nursing gaze, and with it, nursing practice. Furthermore, the ethical implications of the digitally enhanced nursing gaze have yet to be analysed. It is the purpose of this study to make a first step in this direction. By focusing on digitally enhanced monitoring technologies in long-term care, these technologies are interpreted as liquid surveillance, an approach introduced by Zygmunt Bauman. The Baumanian concept of adiaphorisation, that is the detachment of social action from moral evaluation, is used as normative framework of the analysis. The analysis shows that the tendency to remove surveillance practices from moral evaluation by framing them as enablers of an active, healthy life and as tools for caring for the vulnerable, the stereoscopic vision of the nursing gaze is undermined."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1111/nup.12388,""Humans","*Ethics, Nursing",Long-Term Care,Morals,"Technology"",35355391,PMC10078243",,,,

METHODS: Ethics committee approval was obtained in this prospective analysis. The study included 2000 mammograms. The mammograms were interpreted by the radiologists and breast ultrasound was performed for all cases. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score was applied regarding the combined evaluation of the mammogram and the ultrasound modalities. Each breast side was individually assessed with the aid of AI scanning in the form of targeted heat-map and then, a probability of malignancy (abnormality scoring percentage) was obtained. Operative and the histopathology data were the standard of reference. RESULTS: Normal assigned cases (BI-RADS 1) with no lesions were excluded from the statistical evaluation. The study included 538 benign and 642 malignant breast lesions (n = 1180, 59%). BI-RADS categories for the breast lesions with regard to the combined evaluation of the digital mammogram and ultrasound were assigned BI-RADS 2 (Benign) in 385 lesions with AI median value of the abnormality scoring percentage of 10 (n = 385/1180, 32.6%), and BI-RADS 5 (malignant) in 471, that had showed median percentage AI value of 88 (n = 471/1180, 39.9%). AI abnormality scoring of 59% yielded a sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 90.1% in the discrimination of the breast lesions detected on the included mammograms. CONCLUSION: AI could be considered as an optional primary reliable complementary tool to the digital mammogram for the evaluation of the breast lesions. The color hue and the abnormality scoring percentage presented a credible method for the detection and discrimination of breast cancer of near accuracy to the breast ultrasound. So consequently, AI- mammogram combination could be used as a one setting method to discriminate between cases that require further imaging or biopsy from those that need only time interval follows up. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Recently, the indulgence of AI in the work-up of breast cancer was concerned. AI noted as a screening strategy for the detection of breast cancer. In the current work, the performance of AI was studied with regard to the diagnosis not just the detection of breast cancer in the mammographic-detected breast lesions. The evaluation was concerned with AI as a possible complementary reading tool to mammogram and included the qualitative assessment of the color hue and the quantitative integration of the abnormality scoring percentage."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1259/bjr.20210820,""Adult",*Artificial Intelligence,Breast/diagnostic imaging,Breast Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging,Female,Humans,Mammography/*methods,Middle Aged,

Newer strategies with high feasibility and acceptability are always being researched. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of technology-based intervention in improving medication compliance in individuals with schizophrenia. METHOD: This was a prospective intervention study where participants were required to use the SuperMD smartphone application (Digital-Health Technologies Pte Ltd, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) for a month. A change in the Medication Adherence Rating Scale-Malay Translation (MARS-M) and Malay Translation of Drug Adherence Inventory-9 (MDAI-9) scores indicated a change in compliance and attitude to medication. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to assess change in symptoms and insight. Medication compliance was also obtained from the SuperMD application. Paired T-test was used to evaluate the significance of changes in mean scores of research variables over the study period. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the subscale of MDAI-9 and the change in PANSS score. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine the effect of the change of insight on the level of compliance with medication. RESULTS: There were 36 participants in this study. The results showed statistically significant improvement in compliance (0.65, p = 0.01) but not in attitude towards medication (0.78, p = 0.065). There was also an improvement in PANNS score (-2.58, P = 0.01).

A promising approach for solving this problem is to compare gene networks built using experimental gene sets with random networks. One of the resources that make such an analysis possible is CrossTalkZ, which uses the FunCoup database. However, existing methods, including CrossTalkZ, do not take into account individual types of interactions, such as protein/protein interactions, expression regulation, transport regulation, catalytic reactions, etc., but rather work with generalized types characterizing the existence of any connection between network members. RESULTS: We developed the online tool FunGeneNet, which utilizes the ANDSystem and STRING to reconstruct gene networks using experimental gene sets and to estimate their difference from random networks. To compare the reconstructed networks with random ones, the node permutation algorithm implemented in CrossTalkZ was taken as a basis. To study the FunGeneNet applicability, the functional connectivity analysis of networks constructed for gene sets involved in the Gene Ontology biological processes was conducted. We showed that the method sensitivity exceeds 0.8 at a specificity of 0.95. We found that the significance level of the difference between gene networks of biological processes and random networks is determined by the type of connections considered between objects. At the same time, the highest reliability is achieved for the generalized form of connections that takes into account all the individual types of connections. By taking examples of the thyroid cancer networks and the apoptosis network, it is demonstrated that key participants in these processes are involved in the interactions of those types by which these networks differ from random ones. CONCLUSIONS: FunGeneNet is a web tool aimed at proving the functionality of networks in a wide range of sizes of experimental gene sets, both for different global networks and for different types of interactions. Using examples of thyroid cancer and apoptosis networks, we have shown that the links over-represented in the analyzed network in comparison with the random ones make possible a biological interpretation of the original gene/protein sets.

However, its significant impact on livestock animals often goes underdiscussed as more focus is given to impact of livestock production on climate change. Implementing high-welfare systems, such as digital monitoring of animals, can help mitigate climate-related challenges by reducing temperature fluctuations and controlling disease spread. Despite the potential benefits, consumer acceptance of this digital innovation remains uncertain. This study examines consumer attitudes toward digitally monitored animal welfare practices, aiming to understand their acceptance and the values they associate with these practices. It investigates the role of digital technology in enhancing consumer decision-making by addressing animal welfare concerns. Using means-end chain theory and Schwartz's value typology, the research explores the motivational layers and product attributes tied to consumer values. Semi-structured interviews with twenty pork consumers revealed hierarchical relationships between product attributes, benefits, and values. Analysis through NVivo 14 and LadderUX software generated themes and a hierarchical value map. The findings indicate that consumers prioritise attributes such as animal diets, stress-free environments, humane processing practices, and health conditions, linking these to both ethical and hedonic values. Intrinsic attributes like product appearance and freshness are crucial for at-home consumption decisions, while sustainable packaging also plays a role. The study also found differences in consumer behaviour based on the consumption context, with ethical decision-making often shifting to restaurateurs when dining out. The research underscores the importance of transparency, ethical practices, and product quality in influencing consumer decisions, providing actionable insights for marketing strategies that promote ethical consumption and improve animal welfare standards."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.appet.2025.107853,Humans",*Animal Welfare/ethics,*Consumer Behavior,Animals,Female,Male,Adult,Middle Aged,Predictive Value of Tests

In order to effectively achieve this goal, it is critical that researchers have high quality interaction datasets available to them, in a standard data format, and also a suite of tools with which to analyse such data and form experimentally testable hypotheses from them. The PSI-MI XML standard interchange format was initially published in 2004, and expanded in 2007 to enable the download and interchange of molecular interaction data. PSI-XML2.5 was designed to describe experimental data and to date has fulfilled this basic requirement. However, new use cases have arisen that the format cannot properly accommodate. These include data abstracted from more than one publication such as allosteric/cooperative interactions and protein complexes, dynamic interactions and the need to link kinetic and affinity data to specific mutational changes. RESULTS: The Molecular Interaction workgroup of the HUPO-PSI has extended the existing, well-used XML interchange format for molecular interaction data to meet new use cases and enable the capture of new data types, following extensive community consultation. PSI-MI XML3.0 expands the capabilities of the format beyond simple experimental data, with a concomitant update of the tool suite which serves this format. The format has been implemented by key data producers such as the International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) Consortium of protein interaction databases and the Complex Portal. CONCLUSIONS: PSI-MI XML3.0 has been developed by the data producers, data users, tool developers and database providers who constitute the PSI-MI workgroup. This group now actively supports PSI-MI XML2.5 as the main interchange format for experimental data, PSI-MI XML3.0 which additionally handles more complex data types, and the simpler, tab-delimited MITAB2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 for rapid parsing and download."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2118-1,""Databases, Protein",Humans,Mutation/genetics,*Protein Interaction Maps,Proteome/*metabolism,*Proteomics,"Systems Biology"",29642841,PMC5896046",,

It affects an estimated 20% of the general population, based on cohort studies of varying size and heterogeneous selection. However, the prevalence and incidence of recorded NAFLD diagnoses in unselected real-world health-care records is unknown. We harmonised health records from four major European territories and assessed age- and sex-specific point prevalence and incidence of NAFLD over the past decade. METHODS: Data were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (UK), Health Search Database (Italy), Information System for Research in Primary Care (Spain) and Integrated Primary Care Information (Netherlands). Each database uses a different coding system. Prevalence and incidence estimates were pooled across databases by random-effects meta-analysis after a log-transformation. RESULTS: Data were available for 17,669,973 adults, of which 176,114 had a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD. Pooled prevalence trebled from 0.60% in 2007 (95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.79) to 1.85% (0.91-2.79) in 2014. Incidence doubled from 1.32 (0.83-1.82) to 2.35 (1.29-3.40) per 1000 person-years.

Tools and methods that contribute to increased ethical awareness and support for nurses dealing with moral issues are lacking. Technological innovations may be suitable for ethics work, but little research has been conducted on how such solutions could be designed or their potential benefit. Therefore, this study contributes knowledge about the development and testing of a digital tool for ethics support among nurses. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how digital ethical reflection can support ethics work among nurses working in long-term care. METHODS: A digital ethical reflection tool was designed and tested in nursing homes and home nursing care in collaboration with two Norwegian municipalities. The study used sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. Over a 6-week period, at the end of each shift, nurses digitally reported the ethical challenges they had experienced. Their responses and experiences were described using descriptive statistics. Additionally, focus group interviews were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis (TA). RESULTS: During the study period, 17 nurses reported a total of 223 registrations, with 24.8% stating that they had been in an ethically difficult situation. The digital reporting was perceived as practically applicable and helped to increase nurses' awareness of morally charged situations. The value of the registrations was found to depend on manager participation and the application of the obtained information. The participating nurses become aware that they lacked an arena for meaningful dialogue with and recognition from their manager.

Post-hoc analysis was performed using FRI, FVC and mixed effects models. RESULTS: Lung volumes, determined by FRI, correlated with FVC (lower lung volumes with lower FVC) (R(2) = 0.61, p < 0.001). A negative correlation was observed between specific image based airway radius (siRADaw) at total lung capacity (TLC) and FVC (R(2) = 0.18, p < 0.001). Changes in FVC correlated significantly with changes in lung volumes (R(2) = 0.18, p < 0.001) and siRADaw (R(2) = 0.15, p = 0.002) at week 24 and 48, with siRADaw being more sensitive to change than FVC. Loss in lobe volumes (R(2) = 0.33, p < 0.001), increasing fibrotic tissue (R(2) = 0.33, p < 0.001) and airway radius (R(2) = 0.28, p < 0.001) at TLC correlated with changes in FVC but these changes already occur in the lower lobes when FVC is still considered normal. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that FRI is a superior tool than FVC in capturing of early and clinically relevant, disease progression in a regional manner."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12931-018-0918-5,""Aged","Aged, 80 and over",*Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/*diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology,Male,Middle Aged,

Many supervised learning approaches have been applied to cancer subtype classification in the past few years, especially of deep learning based approaches. Recently, the deep forest model has been proposed as an alternative of deep neural networks to learn hyper-representations by using cascade ensemble decision trees. It has been proved that the deep forest model has competitive or even better performance than deep neural networks in some extent. However, the standard deep forest model may face overfitting and ensemble diversity challenges when dealing with small sample size and high-dimensional biology data. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, so-called BCDForest, to address cancer subtype classification on small-scale biology datasets, which can be viewed as a modification of the standard deep forest model. The BCDForest distinguishes from the standard deep forest model with the following two main contributions: First, a named multi-class-grained scanning method is proposed to train multiple binary classifiers to encourage diversity of ensemble. Meanwhile, the fitting quality of each classifier is considered in representation learning. Second, we propose a boosting strategy to emphasize more important features in cascade forests, thus to propagate the benefits of discriminative features among cascade layers to improve the classification performance. Systematic comparison experiments on both microarray and RNA-Seq gene expression datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in application of cancer subtype classification. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-class-grained scanning and boosting strategy in our model provide an effective solution to ease the overfitting challenge and improve the robustness of deep forest model working on small-scale data. Our model provides a useful approach to the classification of cancer subtypes by using deep learning on high-dimensional and small-scale biology data."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2095-4,""*Algorithms",Databases as Topic,"*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic",Humans,Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics,"Sequence Analysis, RNA"",29671390,PMC5907304",,,

However, the prognostic significance of BIRC5 remains unclear in breast cancer. METHODS: BIRC5 expression and methylation status were evaluated using the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. The relevance between BIRC5 and different clinicopathological features as well as survival information was analyzed using the bc-GenExMiner database and Kaplan-Meier Plotter. BIRC5-drug interaction network was obtained using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. RESULTS: Based on the results from databases and own hospital data, BIRC5 was higher expressed in different breast cancer subtypes compared with the matched normal individuals. Hormone receptors were negatively correlated with BIRC5 expression, whereas the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade, Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) status, basal-like status, and triple-negative status were positively related to BIRC5 level in breast cancer samples with respect to normal tissues. High BIRC5 expression was responsible for shorter relapse-free survival, worse overall survival, reduced distant metastasis free survival, and increased risk of metastatic relapse event. BIRC5-drug interaction network indicated that several common drugs could modulate BIRC5 expression. Furthermore, a positive correlation between BIRC5 andcell-division cycle protein 20 (CDC20) gene was confirmed.

These researches, despite the challenges posed by the lack of population-scale genomic databases, have the potential to revolutionize our approach to high-resolution, population-specific Y-chromosome panels and databases for anthropological and forensic applications. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop the highest-resolution Y-targeted sequencing panel, utilizing time-stamped, core phylogenetic informative mutations identified from high-coverage sequences in the YanHuang cohort. This panel is intended to provide a new tool for forensic complex pedigree search and paternal biogeographical ancestry inference, as well as explore the general patterns of the fine-scale paternal evolutionary history of ethnolinguistically diverse Chinese populations. RESULTS: The sequencing performance of the East Asian-specific Y-chromosomal panel, including 2999-core SNP variants, was found to be robust and reliable. The YHSeqY3000 panel was designed to capture the genetic diversity of Chinese paternal lineages from 3500 years ago, identifying 408 terminal lineages in 2097 individuals across 41 genetically and geographically distinct populations. We identified a fine-scale paternal substructure that was correlating with ancient population migrations and expansions. New evidence was provided for extensive gene flow events between minority ethnic groups and Han Chinese people, based on the integrative Chinese Paternal Genomic Diversity Database.

With the development of biotechnology, such as gene chip microarray and RNA-sequencing, the high-throughput data generated provide us with more opportunities to infer the gene-gene interaction relationships using gene expression data and hence understand the underlying mechanism of biological processes. Gene regulatory networks are known to exhibit a multiplicity of interaction mechanisms which include functional and non-functional, and linear and non-linear relationships. Meanwhile, the regulatory interactions between genes and gene products are not spontaneous since various processes involved in producing fully functional and measurable concentrations of transcriptional factors/proteins lead to a delay in gene regulation. Many different approaches for reconstructing GRNs have been proposed, but the existing GRN inference approaches such as probabilistic Boolean networks and dynamic Bayesian networks have various limitations and relatively low accuracy. Inferring GRNs from time series microarray data or RNA-sequencing data remains a very challenging inverse problem due to its nonlinearity, high dimensionality, sparse and noisy data, and significant computational cost, which motivates us to develop more effective inference methods. RESULTS: We developed a novel algorithm, MICRAT (Maximal Information coefficient with Conditional Relative Average entropy and Time-series mutual information), for inferring GRNs from time series gene expression data. Maximal information coefficient (MIC) is an effective measure of dependence for two-variable relationships. It captures a wide range of associations, both functional and non-functional, and thus has good performance on measuring the dependence between two genes. Our approach mainly includes two procedures. Firstly, it employs maximal information coefficient for constructing an undirected graph to represent the underlying relationships between genes. Secondly, it directs the edges in the undirected graph for inferring regulators and their targets. In this procedure, the conditional relative average entropies of each pair of nodes (or genes) are employed to indicate the directions of edges. Since the time delay might exist in the expression of regulators and target genes, time series mutual information is combined to cooperatively direct the edges for inferring the potential regulators and their targets. We evaluated the performance of MICRAT by applying it to synthetic datasets as well as real gene expression data and compare with other GRN inference methods. We inferred five 10-gene and five 100-gene networks from the DREAM4 challenge that were generated using the gene expression simulator GeneNetWeaver (GNW). MICRAT was also used to reconstruct GRNs on real gene expression data including part of the DNA-damaged response pathway (SOS DNA repair network) and experimental dataset in E. Coli. The results showed that MICRAT significantly improved the inference accuracy, compared to other inference methods, such as TDBN, etc. CONCLUSION: In this work, a novel algorithm, MICRAT, for inferring GRNs from time series gene expression data was proposed by taking into account dependence and time delay of expressions of a regulator and its target genes. This approach employed maximal information coefficients for reconstructing an undirected graph to represent the underlying relationships between genes. The edges were directed by combining conditional relative average entropy with time course mutual information of pairs of genes. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on the benchmark GRNs provided by the DREAM4 challenge and part of the real SOS DNA repair network in E. Coli. The experimental study showed that our approach was comparable to other methods on 10-gene datasets and outperformed other methods on 100-gene datasets in GRN inference from time series datasets."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12918-018-0635-1,*Algorithms",Computational Biology/*methods,Entropy,*Gene Expression Profiling,*Gene Regulatory Networks,"Time Factors,30547796,PMC6293491",,,

The Molecular Signatures Database includes collections of oncogenic and immunologic signatures enabling researchers to compare transcriptional datasets across hundreds of previous studies and leading to important insights in these fields, but such a resource does not currently exist for neuromuscular research. In previous work, we have shown the utility of gene set approaches to understand muscle cell physiology and pathology. METHODS: Following a systematic survey of public muscle data, we passed gene expression profiles from 4305 samples through a robust pre-processing and standardized data analysis pipeline. Two hundred eighty-two samples were discarded based on a battery of rigorous global quality controls. From among the remaining studies, 578 comparisons of interest were identified by a combination of text mining and manual curation of the study meta-data. For each comparison, significantly dysregulated genes (FDR adjusted p < 0.05) were identified. RESULTS: Lists of dysregulated genes were divided between upregulated and downregulated to give 1156 Muscle Gene Sets (MGS). This resource is available for download ( www.sys-myo.com/muscle_gene_sets ) and is accessible through three commonly used functional genomics platforms (GSEA, EnrichR, and WebGestalt). Basic guidance and recommendations are provided for the use of MGS through these platforms. In addition, consensus muscle gene sets were created to capture the overlap between the results of similar studies, and analysis of these highlighted the potential for novel disease-relevant findings. CONCLUSIONS: The MGS resource can be used to investigate the behaviour of any list of genes across previous comparisons of muscle conditions, to compare previous studies to one another, and to explore the functional relationship of muscle dysregulation to the Gene Ontology.

Chi-square tests were used for unpaired comparisons, adjusted for physician clustering. McNemar's test was used for paired comparisons. RESULTS: There were 245/397 (61.7%) positive urine cultures. The cystitis aid sensitivity was 202/245 (82.5%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)) = 77.1%, 86.8%), compared to 167/208 (80.3%) in the previous development cohort (p = 0.54), and 239/245 (97.6%) by family physicians in the current study (p < 0.001). Specificity was low for physicians (10/152, 6.6%) compared to the decision aid (54/152, 35.5%"," p < 0.001, resulting in more antibiotic prescriptions by physicians (381/397, 96.0%) than would occur with decision aid recommendations (300/397, 75.6%, p < 0.001). Unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions where urine cultures were negative would be reduced an absolute 11.1% with cystitis aid recommendations (98/397, 24.7%) compared to usual physician care (142/397, 35.8%"," p = 0.001). Urine cultures would also be reduced (97/397, 24.4% decision aid vs 351/397, 88.4% physicians"," p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A 3-item clinical decision aid demonstrated reproducible accuracy in two cohorts of women with acute cystitis symptoms. Clinically important reductions in total and unnecessary antibiotic use, as well as urine culture testing, could result with routine clinical use compared to current empirical physician management practices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12875-017-0660-y,""Acute Disease",Adolescent,Adult,Aged,"Aged, 80 and over",

In comparison with the cause of diseases like genes, these markers are easier to be captured for the prevention and diagnosis of metabolic diseases. Currently, a large number of metabolic markers of diseases need to be explored, which drive us to do this work. METHODS: The existing metabolite-disease associations were extracted from Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) using a text mining tool NCBO annotator as priori knowledge. Next we calculated the similarity of a pair-wise metabolites based on the similarity of disease sets of them. Then, all the similarities of metabolite pairs were utilized for constructing a weighted metabolite association network (WMAN). Subsequently, the network was utilized for predicting novel metabolic markers of diseases using random walk. RESULTS: Totally, 604 metabolites and 228 diseases were extracted from HMDB. From 604 metabolites, 453 metabolites are selected to construct the WMAN, where each metabolite is deemed as a node, and the similarity of two metabolites as the weight of the edge linking them. The performance of the network is validated using the leave one out method. As a result, the high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.7048) is achieved. The further case studies for identifying novel metabolites of diabetes mellitus were validated in the recent studies. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we presented a novel method for prioritizing metabolite-disease pairs.

To understand which persons and how often these services would be utilized, this study aimed to investigate low vision aids (LVAs) provision in an urban setting and to describe user characteristics and trends in their characteristics. METHODS: A retrospective study based on a population-based healthcare claims database in Cologne (N = ~ 500,000), Germany. The study population comprised individuals, who were continuously insured at four large statutory health insurers and who redeemed a prescription for visual aids or aids for blindness between January 2014 and December 2017. We examined their socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Trends in characteristics were examined with logistic and linear regression models over time. RESULTS: Out of ~ 500,000 persons, 781 unique individuals (~ 0.2%) redeemed an LVA prescription. They were mainly female (68.7%), 60 years or older (75.3%) and had macular degeneration (50.6%) and/or glaucoma (25.9%). In the working-age subgroup, 33.8% were employed. Visual aids were most often prescribed (74.1%) and of all types of LVAs, individuals most commonly redeemed a prescription for magnifiers (35.8%), screen readers (34.3%) and/or canes (17.1%). Of the entire study population, 75.4% received their prescription from an ophthalmologist, 5.3% from a general practitioner and 7.1% from other medical specialists. Significant trends in characteristics of individuals who redeemed an LVA prescription were not found. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2014 and 2017, 781 individuals in Cologne redeemed an LVA prescription. They had characteristics which mostly can be explained by the epidemiology of VI. Results indicate that individuals that redeemed LVAs have a magnification requirement of = 1.5-fold and = 6-fold. Furthermore, next to ophthalmologists, general practitioners and other medical specialists seem to play a role in LVA provision as well, which should be taken into account by policy makers when planning interventions for increasing LVS provision.

The network structure changes from the significance of biological experiments and layout algorithms often sacrifice low-level details to maintain high-level information, which complicates the entire image to large biochemical systems such as human metabolic pathways. RESULTS: Our work is inspired by concepts from urban planning since we create a visual hierarchy of biological pathways, which is analogous to city blocks and grid-like road networks in an urban area. We automatize the manual drawing process of biologists by first partitioning the map domain into multiple sub-blocks, and then building the corresponding pathways by routing edges schematically, to maintain the global and local context simultaneously. Our system incorporates constrained floor-planning and network-flow algorithms to optimize the layout of sub-blocks and to distribute the edge density along the map domain. We have developed the approach in close collaboration with domain experts and present their feedback on the pathway diagrams based on selected use cases.

The addition of genomic information is expected to increase the precision of an individual patient's treatment, resulting in improved outcomes. While pilot studies have been encouraging, key aspects of interpreting tumor genomics information, such as somatic activation of drug transport or metabolism, have not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: In this work, we developed a simple rule-based approach to classify the therapies administered to each patient from The Cancer Genome Atlas PanCancer dataset (n = 2858) as effective or ineffective. Our Therapy Efficacy model used each patient's drug target and pharmacokinetic (PK) gene expression profile"," the specific genes considered for each patient depended on the therapies they received. Patients who received predictably ineffective therapies were considered at high-risk of cancer-related mortality and those who did not receive ineffective therapies were considered at low-risk. The utility of our Therapy Efficacy model was assessed using per-cancer and pan-cancer differential survival. RESULTS: Our simple rule-based Therapy Efficacy model classified 143 (5%) patients as high-risk. High-risk patients had age ranges comparable to low-risk patients of the same cancer type and tended to be later stage and higher grade (odds ratios of 1.6 and 1.4, respectively). A significant pan-cancer association was identified between predictions of our Therapy Efficacy model and poorer overall survival (hazard ratio, HR = 1.47, p = 6.3 × 10(- 3)). Individually, drug export (HR = 1.49, p = 4.70 × 10(- 3)) and drug metabolism (HR = 1.73, p = 9.30 × 10(- 5)) genes demonstrated significant survival associations. Survival associations for target gene expression are mechanism-dependent. Similar results were observed for event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: While the resolution of clinical information within the dataset is not ideal, and modeling the relative contribution of each gene to the activity of each therapy remains a challenge, our approach demonstrates that somatic PK alterations should be integrated into the interpretation of somatic transcriptomic profiles as they likely have a significant impact on the survival of specific patients. We believe that this approach will aid the prospective design of personalized therapeutic strategies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12885-018-4345-2,""Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use",Datasets as Topic,Gene Expression Profiling,Humans,"*Models, Biological",Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics,Pharmacogenomic Variants/genetics,

In two experiments, we used Bayesian-hierarchical multinomial modeling to correlate participant-level storage and retrieval processes from LTM recall to WMC abilities estimated from operation and symmetry complex span tasks. In Experiment 1, we presented participants with 20 consecutive words, including semantically associated pairs (e.g., knife and fork), to assess LTM processes. Participants received standard (n = 242) or associative-storage instructions (n = 222) and then completed a free recall task. In Experiment 2, we instructed participants (N = 239) to memorize 40 cue-target words as pairs before completing free and cued recall tasks. Correlations with WMC emerged with storage and retrieval processes and only when an associative storage strategy was instructed (Experiment 1).

The left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI), an integrated parameter reflecting overall left ventricular function, may serve as a reliable and practical prognosticator for sepsis. METHODS: Using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database, we carried out a retrospective observational study that included adult patients who met the Sepsis-3 criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were applied to examine the association between LVSWI and 30-day all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic spline plots were used to assess the non-linear relationship between LVSWI and mortality, and subgroup analyses were conducted across various variables. RESULTS: A total of 1,348 septic patients were included, with 300 (22.3%) fatalities. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, a significant negative relationship between LVSWI and mortality was observed, with a 31% reduction in mortality risk associated with an increase of one standard deviation in LVSWI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.93, p = 0.016), following adjustment for confounders. Restricted cubic spline plots unveiled a non-linear, L-shaped relationship between LVSWI and mortality. Furthermore, a two-piecewise regression model identified the critical inflection point at 27.83 g·m/m², with HR (95% CI) values of 0.93 (0.90-0.96", p < 0.001) on the left and 1.00 (0.99-1.01," p = 0.913) on the right. CONCLUSIONS: The LVSWI exhibited an L-shaped relationship with 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis, underscoring the potential of LVSWI as a dependable prognostic indicator for sepsis.

One solution to this is to use face-to-face meetings, but these can be expensive and time-consuming for teams that are not co-located. Remote collaboration is possible, of course, but one difficulty here is that domain specialists use a wide-variety of different """"formalisms"""" to represent and share their data - by the far most common, however, is the """"office file"""" either in the form of a word-processor document or a spreadsheet.

METHODS: Missense variants from the genome sequences of 300 probands from the Rare Genomes Project with suspected rare disease were analyzed using computational prediction tools that were able to reach PP3_Strong and BP4_Moderate evidence strengths (BayesDel, MutPred2, REVEL, and VEST4). The numbers of variants at each evidence strength were analyzed across disease-associated genes and genome-wide. RESULTS: From a median of 75.5 rare (=1% allele frequency) missense variants in disease-associated genes per proband, a median of one reached PP3_Strong, 3-5 PP3_Moderate, and 3-5 PP3_Supporting. Most were allocated BP4 evidence (median 41-49 per proband) or were indeterminate (median 17.5-19 per proband).

Image Quality Transfer (IQT) is a machine learning framework to enhance images based on high-quality references that has recently adapted to LF MRI. In this study we aim to assess if it can improve lesion visualisation compared to LF MRI scans in children with epilepsy. METHODS: T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR were acquired from 12 patients (5 to 18 years old, 7 males) with clinical diagnosis of intractable epilepsy on a 0.36T (LF) and a 1.5T scanner (HF). LF images were enhanced with IQT. Seven radiologists blindly evaluated the differentiation between normal grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and the extension and definition of epileptogenic lesions in LF, HF and IQT-enhanced images. RESULTS: When images were evaluated independently, GM-WM differentiation scores of IQT outputs were 26% higher, 17% higher and 12% lower than LF for T1, T2 and FLAIR. Lesion definition scores were 8-34% lower than LF, but became 3% higher than LF for FLAIR and T1 when images were seen side by side. Radiologists with expertise at HF scored IQT images higher than those with expertise at LF. CONCLUSION: IQT generally improved the image quality assessments.

METHODS: The Dynamic Planning Module was used for decision making whether a plan adaptation was necessary within one course of radiation therapy. The Module was also used for patients scheduled for re-irradiation to estimate the dose in the pretreated region and calculate the accumulated dose to critical organs at risk. During one year, 370 patients were scheduled for plan adaptation or re-irradiation. All patient cases were classified according to their treated body region. For a sub-group of 20 patients treated with RT for lung cancer, the dosimetric effect of plan adaptation during the main treatment course was evaluated in detail. Changes in tumor volume, frequency of re-planning and the time interval between treatment start and plan adaptation were assessed. RESULTS: The Dynamic Planning Tool was used in 20% of treated patients per year for both approaches nearly equally (42% plan adaptation and 58% re-irradiation). Most cases were assessed for the thoracic body region (51%) followed by pelvis (21%) and head and neck cases (10%). The sub-group evaluation showed that unintended plan adaptation was performed in 38% of the scheduled cases. A median time span between first day of treatment and necessity of adaptation of 17 days (range 4-35 days) was observed. PTV changed by 12 ± 12% on average (maximum change 42%). PTV decreased in 18 of 20 cases due to tumor shrinkage and increased in 2 of 20 cases. Re-planning resulted in a reduction of the mean lung dose of the ipsilateral side in 15 of 20 cases. CONCLUSION: The experience of one year showed high acceptance of the Dynamic Planning Module in our department for both physicians and medical physicists. The re-planning can potentially reduce the accumulated dose to the organs at risk and ensure a better target volume coverage.

This often entails merging the linear deductive approach of health research with the explorative iterative approach of data science. However, there is a lack of structured teaching courses and guidance on how to effectively and constructively bridge different disciplines and research approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a set of tools and recommendations designed to facilitate interdisciplinary education and collaboration. Target groups are lecturers who can use these tools to design interdisciplinary courses, supervisors who guide PhD and master's students in their interdisciplinary projects, and principal investigators who design and organize workshops to initiate and guide interdisciplinary projects. METHODS: Our study was conducted in 3 steps: (1) developing a common terminology, (2) identifying established workflows for research question formulation, and (3) examining adaptations of existing study workflows combining methods from health research and data science. We also formulated recommendations for a pragmatic implementation of our findings. We conducted a literature search and organized 3 interdisciplinary expert workshops with researchers at the University of Zurich. For the workshops and the subsequent manuscript writing process, we adopted a consensus study methodology. RESULTS: We developed a set of tools to facilitate interdisciplinary education and collaboration. These tools focused on 2 key dimensions- content and curriculum and methods and teaching style-and can be applied in various educational and research settings. We developed a glossary to establish a shared understanding of common terminologies and concepts. We delineated the established study workflow for research question formulation, emphasizing the """"what"""" and the """"how,"""" while summarizing the necessary tools to facilitate the process. We propose 3 clusters of contextual and methodological adaptations to this workflow to better integrate data science practices: (1) acknowledging real-life constraints and limitations in research scope"," (2) allowing more iterative, data-driven approaches to research question formulation"," and (3) strengthening research quality through reproducibility principles and adherence to the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles. CONCLUSIONS: Research question formulation remains a relevant and useful research step in projects using digital data. We recommend initiating new interdisciplinary collaborations by establishing terminologies as well as using the concepts of research tasks to foster a shared understanding. Our tools and recommendations can support academic educators in training health professionals and researchers for interdisciplinary digital health projects."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/56369,Humans",*Interdisciplinary Research,Consensus,"Research Design,39847774,PMC11803332",,,

Despite its benefits, data integration introduces internal biases-so-called batch effects. Due to the inherent presence of missing values by such methods and their additional introduction by means of data integration, renowned algorithms such as ComBat and limma are unable to perform batch effect adjustment. Recently, the HarmonizR framework was presented for these cases, which is a tool for missing value tolerant data adjustment. RESULTS: In this contribution, we provide significant improvements to the HarmonizR approach. A novel blocking strategy is introduced to severely reduce runtime, while still supporting parallel architectures. Additionally, a """"unique removal"""" strategy has been integrated into HarmonizR to maintain even more features for adjustment in datasets, showing a feature rescue of up to 103.9% for our tested datasets. In this work, we show (1) severely improved runtime for both small and large, real datasets and (2) the ability retain more features from the integrated dataset during adjustment, showing a feature rescue of up to 103.9% for our tested datasets. CONCLUSION: The proposed improvements tackle the previous shortcomings of the published HarmonizR version. Since HarmonizR was mainly developed for dataset integration on rare tumor entities, it did not include runtime improvements beyond parallelization, which has been addressed in this update. An additionally welcome update regarding improved feature rescue furthermore enhances the algorithms ability to quickly and robustly perform batch effect reduction."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-025-06073-9,*Algorithms",*Software,Computational Biology/methods,Proteomics/methods,"Humans,39934730,PMC11817103",,,,

Experimental approaches and computational modelling methods are generating biological data at an unprecedented rate. The detailed analysis of structure-sequence relationships is critical to unveil governing principles of protein folding, stability and function. Computational protein design (CPD) has emerged as an important structure-based approach to engineer proteins for novel functions. Generally, CPD workflows rely on the generation of large numbers of structural models to search for the optimal structure-sequence configurations. As such, an important step of the CPD process is the selection of a small subset of sequences to be experimentally characterized. Given the limitations of current CPD scoring functions, multi-step design protocols and elaborated analysis of the decoy populations have become essential for the selection of sequences for experimental characterization and the success of CPD strategies. RESULTS: Here, we present the rstoolbox, a Python library for the analysis of large-scale structural data tailored for CPD applications. rstoolbox is oriented towards both CPD software users and developers, being easily integrated in analysis workflows. For users, it offers the ability to profile and select decoy sets, which may guide multi-step design protocols or for follow-up experimental characterization. rstoolbox provides intuitive solutions for the visualization of large sequence/structure datasets (e.g. logo plots and heatmaps) and facilitates the analysis of experimental data obtained through traditional biochemical techniques (e.g. circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance) and high-throughput sequencing. For CPD software developers, it provides a framework to easily benchmark and compare different CPD approaches. Here, we showcase the rstoolbox in both types of applications. CONCLUSIONS: rstoolbox is a library for the evaluation of protein structures datasets tailored for CPD data. It provides interactive access through seamless integration with IPython, while still being suitable for high-performance computing. In addition to its functionalities for data analysis and graphical representation, the inclusion of rstoolbox in protein design pipelines will allow to easily standardize the selection of design candidates, as well as, to improve the overall reproducibility and robustness of CPD selection processes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-019-2796-3,Amino Acid Sequence",Computational Biology/*methods,Computing Methodologies,Proteins/*chemistry,Reproducibility of Results,"*Software,31092198,PMC6521408",,,

Fortunately, many tasks of systematic reviews have the potential to be automated or may be assisted by automation. Recent advances in natural language processing, text mining and machine learning have produced new algorithms that can accurately mimic human endeavour in systematic review activity, faster and more cheaply. Automation tools need to be able to work together, to exchange data and results. Therefore, we initiated the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR), to successfully put all the parts of automation of systematic review production together. The first meeting was held in Vienna in October 2015. We established a set of principles to enable tools to be developed and integrated into toolkits.This paper sets out the principles devised at that meeting, which cover the need for improvement in efficiency of SR tasks, automation across the spectrum of SR tasks, continuous improvement, adherence to high quality standards, flexibility of use and combining components, the need for a collaboration and varied skills, the desire for open source, shared code and evaluation, and a requirement for replicability through rigorous and open evaluation.Automation has a great potential to improve the speed of systematic reviews. Considerable work is already being done on many of the steps involved in a review. The 'Vienna Principles' set out in this paper aim to guide a more coordinated effort which will allow the integration of work by separate teams and build on the experience, code and evaluations done by the many teams working across the globe."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13643-018-0740-7,Algorithms",Automation/methods/*standards,Cooperative Behavior,*Data Accuracy,Data Mining,Humans,Machine Learning,Natural Language Processing,

Serious gaming and gamification education have the potential to provide a quality, cost-effective, novel approach that is flexible, portable, and enjoyable and allow interaction with tutors and peers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious gaming/gamification for health professions education compared with traditional learning, other types of digital education, or other serious gaming/gamification interventions in terms of patient outcomes, knowledge, skills, professional attitudes, and satisfaction (primary outcomes) as well as economic outcomes of education and adverse events (secondary outcomes). METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Educational Resources Information Centre, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted from 1990 to August 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and assessed the study quality and extracted data. A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. Therefore, a narrative synthesis is presented. RESULTS: A total of 27 RCTs and 3 cluster RCTs with 3634 participants were included. Two studies evaluated gamification interventions, and the remaining evaluated serious gaming interventions. One study reported a small statistically significant difference between serious gaming and digital education of primary care physicians in the time to control blood pressure in a subgroup of their patients already taking antihypertensive medications. There was evidence of a moderate-to-large magnitude of effect from five studies evaluating individually delivered interventions for objectively measured knowledge compared with traditional learning. There was also evidence of a small-to-large magnitude of effect from 10 studies for improved skills compared with traditional learning. Two and four studies suggested equivalence between interventions and controls for knowledge and skills, respectively. Evidence suggested that serious gaming was at least as effective as other digital education modalities for these outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to conclude whether one type of serious gaming/gamification intervention is more effective than any other. There was limited evidence for the effects of serious gaming/gamification on professional attitudes. Serious gaming/gamification may improve satisfaction, but the evidence was limited. Evidence was of low or very low quality for all outcomes. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to the imprecision, inconsistency, and limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Serious gaming/gamification appears to be at least as effective as controls, and in many studies, more effective for improving knowledge, skills, and satisfaction.

Groups like people with a low socioeconomic position, people with a migrant background or the elderly, who are already most at risk of experiencing health inequalities, are simultaneously experiencing increased digital exclusion. Researchers play a role in determining how eHealth access is framed and can thus impact how the barriers to its use are addressed. This qualitative meta-review critically evaluates the way researchers (as authors) discuss eHealth use in digitally marginalised groups. Specifically, it seeks to understand how eHealth is framed to address existing health systems problems", how the barriers to eHealth use are presented and which solutions are provided in response," and who authors suggest should be responsible for making eHealth work. The results of this review found four paradoxes in how current literature views eHealth use. Firstly, that health systems problems are complex and nuanced, yet eHealth is seen as a simple answer. Secondly, that there are many political, social and health systems-based solutions suggested to address eHealth use, however most of the identified barriers are individually framed. This focus on personal deficits results in misallocating responsibility for making these systemic improvements. Thirdly, although eHealth is meant to simplify the tasks of patients and healthcare workers, these are the groups most often burdened with the responsibility of ensuring its success. Lastly, despite tailoring eHealth to the user being the most suggested solution, researchers generally speak about groups as a homogenous entity - thus rendering tailoring difficult. Ultimately, this review finds that a shift to focus research on addressing systemic issues on a systems level is necessary to prevent further exacerbating existing health inequalities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.116895,Humans",*Telemedicine,*Qualitative Research,"Social Marginalization/psychology,38710135,",,,

The evidence comes from the intersections of synthetic bioengineering, developmental biology, and cognitive and computational sciences. As a regulative principle, synechism, """"that continuity governs the whole domain of experience in every element of it"""", has been shown to infiltrate fundamental issues of contemporary biology, including cognition in different substrates, embodied agency, collectives (swarm and nested), intelligence on multiple scales, and developmental bioelectricity in morphogenesis. In the present paper, we make explicit modern biology's turn to this fundamental feature of science in its rejection of conceptual binaries, preference for collectives over individuals, quantitative over qualitative, and multiscale applicability of the emerging hypotheses about the integration of the first principles of the diversity of life.

Two common approaches to provide a broad overview of the information space are document clustering and topic modeling. Clustering aims to group documents or terms into meaningful clusters. Topic modeling, on the other hand, focuses on finding coherent keywords for describing topics appearing in a set of documents. In addition, there have been efforts for clustering documents and finding keywords simultaneously. RESULTS: We present an algorithm to analyze document collections that is based on a notion of a theme, defined as a dual representation based on a set of documents and key terms. In this work, a novel vector space mechanism is proposed for computing themes. Starting with a single document, the theme algorithm treats terms and documents as explicit components, and iteratively uses each representation to refine the other until the theme is detected. The method heavily relies on an optimization routine that we refer to as the projection algorithm which, under specific conditions, is guaranteed to converge to the first singular vector of a data matrix. We apply our algorithm to a collection of about sixty thousand PubMed (?) documents examining the subject of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, evaluate the results and show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.

We obtained data on mental disorder-related gene methylation, expression, protein levels, and summary statistics of IBD, and performed Summary data-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses to explore the causal associations and shared causal genetic variants between multiple molecular traits and IBD. Integrating multi-omics data, we found QDPR, DBI and MAX are associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) risk, while HP is linked to IBD risk. Inverse associations between gene methylation (cg0880851 and cg26689483) and expression are observed in QDPR, consistent with their detrimental role in UC. Methylation of DBI (cg11066750) protects against UC by enhancing expression.

It represents the ability of replicating an experiment independently by the location and the operator. Therefore, a study can be considered reproducible only if all used data are available and the exploited computational analysis workflow is clearly described. However, today for reproducing a complex bioinformatics analysis, the raw data and the list of tools used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the reproducibility of the results obtained. Indeed, different releases of the same tools and/or of the system libraries (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky reproducibility issues. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we established the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project (RBP), which is a non-profit and open-source project, whose aim is to provide a schema and an infrastructure, based on docker images and R package, to provide reproducible results in Bioinformatics. One or more Docker images are then defined for a workflow (typically one for each task), while the workflow implementation is handled via R-functions embedded in a package available at github repository. Thus, a bioinformatician participating to the project has firstly to integrate her/his workflow modules into Docker image(s) exploiting an Ubuntu docker image developed ad hoc by RPB to make easier this task. Secondly, the workflow implementation must be realized in R according to an R-skeleton function made available by RPB to guarantee homogeneity and reusability among different RPB functions. Moreover she/he has to provide the R vignette explaining the package functionality together with an example dataset which can be used to improve the user confidence in the workflow utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Reproducible Bioinformatics Project provides a general schema and an infrastructure to distribute robust and reproducible workflows. Thus, it guarantees to final users the ability to repeat consistently any analysis independently by the used UNIX-like architecture."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2296-x,Computational Biology/*methods",Humans,MicroRNAs/genetics,Reproducibility of Results,Software,User-Computer Interface,"Workflow,30367595,PMC6191970",,

However, the organizations that collect these data do not always have the necessary social license to use and share it. Although some technology companies have published principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence, the foundational issue of what is and is not acceptable to do with data, not just the analytical tools to manage it, has not been fully considered. Furthermore, it is unclear whether input from the public or patients has been included. In 2017, the leadership at a web-based patient research network began to envision a new kind of community compact that laid out what the company believed, how the company should behave, and what it promised both to the individuals who engaged with them and to the community at large. While having already earned a social license from patient members as a trusted data steward with strong privacy, transparency, and openness policies, the company sought to protect and strengthen that social license by creating a socially and ethically responsible data contract. Going beyond regulatory and legislative requirements, this contract considered the ethical use of multiomics and phenotypic data in addition to patient-reported and generated data. OBJECTIVE: A multistakeholder working group sought to develop easy-to-understand commitments that established expectations for data stewardship, governance, and accountability from those who seek to collect, use, and share personal data. The working group cocreated a framework that was radically patient-first in its thinking and collaborative in the process of its codevelopment"," it reflected the values, ideas, opinions, and perspectives of the cocreators, inclusive of patients and the public. METHODS: Leveraging the conceptual frameworks of cocreation and participatory action research, a mixed methods approach was used that included a landscape analysis, listening sessions, and a 12-question survey. The methodological approaches used by the working group were guided by the combined principles of biomedical ethics and social license and shaped through a collaborative and reflective process with similarities to reflective equilibrium, a method well known in ethics. RESULTS: Commitments for the Digital Age are the output of this work. The six commitments in order of priority are (1) continuous and shared learning", (2) respect and empower individual choice, (3) informed and understood consent, (4) people-first governance, (5) open communication and accountable conduct," and (6) inclusivity, diversity, and equity.

To address this limitation, researchers have aggregated subjects from multiple existing genetic studies, but these subjects can have missing phenotypic information, including diagnostic criteria for certain substances that were not originally a focus of study. Recent advances in addiction neurobiology have shown that comorbid SUDs (e.g., the abuse of multiple substances) have similar genetic determinants, which makes it possible to infer missing SUD diagnostic criteria using criteria from another SUD and patient genotypes through statistical modeling. RESULTS: We propose a new approach based on matrix completion techniques to integrate features of comorbid health conditions and individual's genotypes to infer unreported diagnostic criteria for a disorder. This approach optimizes a bi-linear model that uses the interactions between known disease correlations and candidate genes to impute missing criteria. An efficient stochastic and parallel algorithm was developed to optimize the model with a speed 20 times greater than the classic sequential algorithm. It was tested on 3441 subjects who had both cocaine and opioid use disorders and successfully inferred missing diagnostic criteria with consistently better accuracy than other recent statistical methods.

While various computational methods have been proposed for disease gene prediction, with the recent increasing availability of biological information for genes, it is highly motivated to leverage these valuable data sources and extract useful information for accurately predicting disease genes. RESULTS: We present an integrative framework called N2VKO to predict disease genes. Firstly, we learn the node embeddings from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for genes by adapting the well-known representation learning method node2vec. Secondly, we combine the learned node embeddings with various biological annotations as rich feature representation for genes, and subsequently build binary classification models for disease gene prediction. Finally, as the data for disease gene prediction is usually imbalanced (i.e. the number of the causative genes for a specific disease is much less than that of its non-causative genes), we further address this serious data imbalance issue by applying oversampling techniques for imbalance data correction to improve the prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed N2VKO significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art methods for disease gene prediction across seven diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show that node embeddings learned from PPI networks work well for disease gene prediction, while integrating node embeddings with other biological annotations further improves the performance of classification models. Moreover, oversampling techniques for imbalance correction further enhances the prediction performance. In addition, the literature search of predicted disease genes also shows the effectiveness of our proposed N2VKO framework for disease gene prediction."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12918-018-0662-y,Computational Biology/*methods",Disease/*genetics,Humans,*Molecular Sequence Annotation,"Protein Interaction Mapping,30598097,PMC6311944",,,,

In their genomes, these natural products are encoded by physically clustered genes known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Genome and metagenome sequencing advances have enabled high-throughput identification of BGCs as a promising avenue for natural product discovery. BGC mining from (meta)genomes using in silico tools has allowed access to a vast diversity of potentially novel natural products. However, a fundamental limitation has been the ability to assemble complete BGCs, especially from complex metagenomes. With their fragmented assemblies, short-read technologies struggle to recover complete BGCs, such as the long and repetitive nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS). Recent advances in long-read sequencing, such as the High Fidelity (HiFi) technology from PacBio, have reduced this limitation and can help retrieve both accurate and complete BGCs from metagenomes, warranting improvement in the existing BGC identification approach for better utilization of HiFi data. RESULTS: Here, we present HiFiBGC, a command-line-based workflow to identify BGCs in PacBio HiFi metagenomes. HiFiBGC leverages an ensemble of assemblies from three HiFi-tailored metagenome assemblers and the reads not represented in these assemblies. Based on our analyses of four HiFi metagenomic datasets from four different environments, we show that HiFiBGC identifies, on average, 78% more BGCs than the top-performing single-assembler-based method. This increase is due to HiFiBGC's ensemble assembly approach, which improves recovery by 25%, as well as from the inclusion of mostly fragmented BGCs identified in the unmapped reads. CONCLUSIONS: HiFiBGC is a computational workflow for identifying BGCs in long-read HiFi metagenomes, implemented majorly using Python programming language and workflow manager Snakemake.

In this formulation, each genome is represented as a matrix, and the distance d is the rank distance between these matrices. Although defined in terms of matrices, the rank distance is equal to the minimum total weight of a series of weighted operations that leads from one genome to the other, including inversions, translocations, transpositions, and others. The computational complexity of the median-of-three problem according to this distance is currently unknown. The genome matrices are a special kind of permutation matrices, which we study in this paper. In their paper, the authors provide an [Formula: see text] algorithm for determining three candidate medians, prove the tight approximation ratio [Formula: see text], and provide a sufficient condition for their candidates to be true medians. They also conduct some experiments that suggest that their method is accurate on simulated and real data. RESULTS: In this paper, we extend their results and provide the following: Three invariants characterizing the problem of finding the median of 3 matrices A sufficient condition for uniqueness of medians that can be checked in O(n) A faster, [Formula: see text] algorithm for determining the median under this condition A new heuristic algorithm for this problem based on compressed sensing A [Formula: see text] algorithm that exactly solves the problem when the inputs are orthogonal matrices, a class that includes both permutations and genomes as special cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides the first proof that, with respect to the rank distance, the problem of finding the median of 3 genomes, as well as the median of 3 permutations, is exactly solvable in polynomial time, a result which should be contrasted with its NP-hardness for the DCJ (double cut-and-join) distance and most other families of genome rearrangement operations.

They are also a digitally mature and digitally resilient workforce in healthcare. Artificial intelligence is already changing their clinical practice and roles in data acquisition, post-processing, and workflow management. It is therefore vital to understand the impact of AI on the careers, roles and professional identity of radiographers, as key stakeholders of the digital transformation of healthcare within the medical imaging ecosystem. METHODS: A European radiographer survey, endorsed by the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS), was distributed online. It was piloted with twelve radiographers and translated into eight languages. Although this study included both qualitative and quantitative results, this paper emphasises the quantitative aspect. RESULTS: A total of 2206 European radiographers have responded from 37 different countries. Despite some concerns around workforce deskilling, future professional identity, and job prospects, participants showed overall optimistic views about the use of AI in healthcare. This was particularly strong for those with prior AI education (mean: 2.15 vs. 1.89"," p-value: < 0.001), hands-on experience with AI (correlation: 0.047"," p-value: 0.038), from countries with higher digital literacy (mean: 2.00 vs.1.93", p-value: 0.027) and a higher academic level of radiography education (mean: 3.28 vs. 3.15," p-value: 0.002). Men appeared slightly more enthused about the development of technological skills and women about the honing of patient-centred care skills. Finally, interprofessional collaboration was seen as essential not only for the seamless clinical integration of AI but also for supporting patient benefit. CONCLUSION: While AI implementation advances, AI education needs to keep at pace to ensure acceptability, trust, and safe use of this technology by healthcare professionals, minimising their concerns around professional role changes and enabling them to see the opportunities of service transformation.

These guidelines indicate that several tools should always be used and that full coincidence between them is required if we want to consider their results as supporting evidence in medical decision processes. Application of this simple rule certainly decreases the error rate of in silico pathogenicity assignments. However, when predictors disagree this rule results in the rejection of potentially valuable information for a number of variants. In this work, we focus on these variants of the protein sequence and develop specific predictors to help improve the success rate of their annotation. RESULTS: We have used a set of 59,442 protein sequence variants (15,723 pathological and 43,719 neutral) from 228 proteins to identify those cases for which pathogenicity predictors disagree. We have repeated this process for all the possible combinations of five known methods (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PON-P2, CADD and MutationTaster2). For each resulting subset we have trained a specific pathogenicity predictor. We find that these specific predictors are able to discriminate between neutral and pathogenic variants, with a success rate different from random. They tend to outperform the constitutive methods but this trend decreases as the performance of the constitutive predictor improves (e.g. with PON-P2 and PolyPhen-2). We also find that specific methods outperform standard consensus methods (Condel and CAROL). CONCLUSION: Focusing development efforts on the case of variants for which known methods disagree we may obtain pathogenicity predictors with improved performances. Although we have not yet reached the success rate that allows the use of this computational evidence in a clinical setting, the simplicity of the approach indicates that more advanced methods may reach this goal in a close future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-017-3914-0,""Computational Biology/*methods",*Computer Simulation,*Genetic Variation,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods,Humans,Proteins/genetics,"Sequence Analysis, Protein/*methods","Virulence/*genetics"",28812538,PMC5558188",

State-of-the-art read mappers 1) quickly generate possible mapping locations for seeds (i.e., smaller segments) within each read, 2) extract reference sequences at each of the mapping locations, and 3) check similarity between each read and its associated reference sequences with a computationally-expensive algorithm (i.e., sequence alignment) to determine the origin of the read. A seed location filter comes into play before alignment, discarding seed locations that alignment would deem a poor match. The ideal seed location filter would discard all poor match locations prior to alignment such that there is no wasted computation on unnecessary alignments. RESULTS: We propose a novel seed location filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter, optimized to exploit 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation within a logic layer stacked under memory layers, to perform processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters seed locations by 1) introducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference genome, and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our evaluations show that for a sequence alignment error tolerance of 0.05, GRIM-Filter 1) reduces the false negative rate of filtering by 5.59x-6.41x, and 2) provides an end-to-end read mapper speedup of 1.81x-3.65x, compared to a state-of-the-art read mapper employing the best previous seed location filtering algorithm. CONCLUSION: GRIM-Filter exploits 3D-stacked memory, which enables the efficient use of processing-in-memory, to overcome the memory bandwidth bottleneck in seed location filtering. We show that GRIM-Filter significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art read mapper. GRIM-Filter is a universal seed location filter that can be applied to any read mapper. We hope that our results provide inspiration for new works to design other bioinformatics algorithms that take advantage of emerging technologies and new processing paradigms, such as processing-in-memory using 3D-stacked memory devices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-018-4460-0,""Algorithms","Databases, Genetic","Genome, Human",High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods,Humans,"Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods","Software"",29764378,PMC5954284",,

This may be challenging due to substantial missing values. The missingness in PROs is often closely related to patients' disease status. In that case, using observed information about intercurrent events (ICEs) such as disease progression and death will improve the handling of missing PRO data. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop imputation models for repeated PRO measurements that leverage information about ICEs. METHODS: We assumed a setting in which missing PRO measurements are missing at random given observed measurements, as well as the occurrence and timing of ICEs, and potentially other (baseline or time-varying) covariates. We then showed how these missingness assumptions can be translated into concrete imputation models that also account for a longitudinal data structure. The resulting models were applied to impute anonymized PRO data from a single-arm clinical trial in patients with advanced lung cancer. RESULTS: In our trial example, accounting for death and other ICEs in the imputation of missing data led to lower estimated mean health-related quality of life (while alive) compared to an available case analysis and a naive linear mixed model imputation. CONCLUSION: Information about the timing and occurrence of ICEs contribute to a more plausible handling of missing PRO data. To account for ICE information when handling missing PROs, the missing data model should be separated from the analysis model."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-025-02510-8,""Humans",*Patient Reported Outcome Measures,*Quality of Life,Lung Neoplasms/mortality/therapy,"Data Interpretation, Statistical",Disease Progression,"Models, Statistical"",40025441,PMC11872335",,

To date, all phylogenetically diverse benchmarks known to the authors include only query sequences with single protein domains. Domains are the primary building blocks of protein structure and function. Independently, each domain can fulfill a single function, but most proteins (>80% in Metazoa) exist as multi-domain proteins. Multiple domain units combine in various arrangements or architectures to create different functions and are often under evolutionary pressures to yield new ones. Thus, it is crucial to create gold standards reflecting the multi-domain complexity of real proteins to more accurately evaluate sequence searching tools. DESCRIPTION: This work introduces MultiDomainBenchmark (MDB), a database suite of 412 curated multi-domain queries and 227,512 target sequences, representing at least 5108 species and 1123 phylogenetically divergent protein families, their relevancy annotation, and domain location.

Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great interest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network. RESULTS: Here, we present an R package for calculating the weighted topological overlap (wTO), that, in contrast to existing packages, explicitly addresses the sign of the wTO values, and is thus especially valuable for the analysis of gene regulatory networks. The package includes the calculation of p-values (raw and adjusted) for each pairwise gene score. Our package also allows the calculation of networks from time series (without replicates). Since networks from independent datasets (biological repeats or related studies) are not the same due to technical and biological noise in the data, we additionally, incorporated a novel method for calculating a consensus network (CN) from two or more networks into our R package. To graphically inspect the resulting networks, the R package contains a visualization tool, which allows for the direct network manipulation and access of node and link information. When testing the package on a standard laptop computer, we can conduct all calculations for systems of more than 20,000 genes in under two hours. We compare our new wTO package to state of art packages and demonstrate the application of the wTO and CN functions using 3 independently derived datasets from healthy human pre-frontal cortex samples. To showcase an example for the time series application we utilized a metagenomics data set. CONCLUSION: In this work, we developed a software package that allows the computation of wTO networks, CNs and a visualization tool in the R statistical environment.

How to store, transmit and analyze these data has become a hotspot in the current research. Now the compression algorithm based on reference is widely used due to its high compression ratio. There exists a big problem that the data from different gene banks can't merge directly and share information efficiently, because these data are usually compressed with different references. The traditional workflow is decompression-and-recompression, which is too simple and time-consuming. We should improve it and speed it up. RESULTS: In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a set of transformation algorithms to cope with it. We will 1) analyze some different compression algorithms to find the similarities and the differences among all of them, 2) come up with a naïve method named TDM for data transformation between difference gene banks and finally 3) optimize former method TDM and propose the method named TPI and the method named TGI. A number of experiment result proved that the three algorithms we proposed are an order of magnitude faster than traditional decompression-and-recompression workflow. CONCLUSIONS: Firstly, the three algorithms we proposed all have good performance in terms of time. Secondly, they have their own different advantages faced with different dataset or situations.

This is often in contrast to the diagnostic methodology in radiology where presumed pathologic findings are correlated to prior studies and subsequent changes over time. For multiple sclerosis (MS), the current body of literature describes various forms of lesion segmentation with few studies analyzing disability progression over time. For the purpose of longitudinal time-dependent analysis, we propose a combinatorial analysis of a video vision transformer (ViViT) benchmarked against traditional recurrent neural network of Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) architectures and a hybrid Vision Transformer-LSTM (ViT-LSTM) to predict long-term disability based upon the Extended Disability Severity Score (EDSS). The patient cohort was procured from a two-site institution with 703 patients' multisequence, contrast-enhanced MRIs of the cervical spine between the years 2002 and 2023. Following a competitive performance analysis, a VGG-16-based CNN-LSTM was compared to ViViT with an ablation analysis to determine time-dependency of the models. The VGG16-LSTM predicted trinary classification of EDSS score in 6 years with 0.74 AUC versus the ViViT with 0.84 AUC (p-value < 0.001 per 5 × 2 cross-validation F-test) on an 80:20 hold-out testing split. However, the VGG16-LSTM outperformed ViViT when patients with only 2 years of MRIs (n = 94) (0.75 AUC versus 0.72 AUC, respectively).

While ideal for straightforward analysis, confidentiality restrictions forbid creation of a single dataset that includes covariate information of all participants. Current approaches such as aggregate data sharing, distributed regression, meta-analysis and score-based methods can have important limitations. METHODS: We propose a novel application of an existing epidemiologic tool, specimen pooling, to enable confidentiality-preserving analysis of data arising from a matched case-control, multi-center design. Instead of pooling specimens prior to assay, we apply the methodology to virtually pool (aggregate) covariates within nodes. Such virtual pooling retains most of the information used in an analysis with individual data and since individual participant data is not shared externally, within-node virtual pooling preserves data confidentiality. We show that aggregated covariate levels can be used in a conditional logistic regression model to estimate individual-level odds ratios of interest. RESULTS: The parameter estimates from the standard conditional logistic regression are compared to the estimates based on a conditional logistic regression model with aggregated data. The parameter estimates are shown to be similar to those without pooling and to have comparable standard errors and confidence interval coverage.

Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was employed to identify clinical, sociodemographic and TB specific risk factors for recurrence. RESULTS: From a cohort of 4628 patients, 82 TB recurrences occurred (1.8%).

Hence, there is an imminent need to understand the implications of MTs for disease- diagnosis. However, studies of cellular processes like MTs are often constrained by physical limitations of their data acquisition systems such as optical microscopes and are vulnerable to either destruction of the specimen or the probe. In addition, study of MTs is challenged with non-uniform sampling of the MT dynamic instability phenomenon relative to its time-lapse observation of the cellular processes. Thus, the above caveats limit the overall period of time that the MT data can be collected, thereby causing limited data availability scenario. RESULTS: In this work, two novel superresolution frameworks based on Expectation Maximization (EM) based Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation using Kalman filters (MLK) technique are proposed to address the issues of non-uniform sampling and limited data availability of MT signals. The proposed MLK methods optimizes prediction of missing observations in the MT signal through information extraction using correlation-based patch processing and principal component analysis -based mutual information. Experimental results prove that the proposed MLK-based superresolution methods outperformed nonlinear interpolation and compressed sensing methods. CONCLUSIONS: This work aims to address limited data availability and data/observation loss incurred due to non-uniform sampling of biological signals such as MTs. For this purpose, statistical modelling of stochastic MT signals using EM based ML driven Kalman estimation (MLK) is considered as a fundamental framework for prediction of missing MT observations. It was experimentally validated that the proposed superresolution methods provided superior overall performance, better MT signal estimation using fewer samples, high SNR, low errors, and better MT parameter estimation than other methods."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12918-018-0631-5,""Computational Biology/*methods",Likelihood Functions,Microtubules/*metabolism,"Models, Biological","Stochastic Processes"",30463571,PMC6249719",,,,

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationships between digital health literacy, distrust in health systems, and health anxiety and the effects of these two factors on health anxiety in students studying health sciences. The cross-sectional study population comprised students from the Health Sciences departments at Kutahya Health Sciences University during the 2024-2025 academic year. The study data were collected using a questionnaire form prepared online for the students studying in these departments. A total of 752 questionnaire forms were analyzed. The average age of the students who participated in the study was 21.42 ± 1.68 years, and 71% of the students were female. A total of 15.16% of the students were studying in the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, and 97.47% of them accessed the Internet via mobile phones. According to the correlation analysis, there was a positive correlation between health anxiety and distrust in health systems and a negative correlation between health anxiety and digital health literacy. According to the multiple regression analysis results, digital health literacy and distrust in health systems explained 21.9% of the change in health anxiety. As a result, health anxiety decreases significantly as the level of digital health literacy increases. Therefore, it is recommended that students studying in these departments receive continuous education on digital health."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12909-025-06903-7,""Humans",Female,*Health Literacy,Male,Cross-Sectional Studies,Young Adult,*Trust,*Anxiety/epidemiology,

With the advent of multiple high-throughput sequencing technologies, new protein sequences are becoming available at an extraordinary rate. The rapid growth rate has impeded deployment of existing protein clustering/annotation tools which depend largely on pairwise sequence alignment. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose an alignment-free clustering approach, coreClust, for annotating protein sequences using detected conserved regions. The proposed algorithm uses Min-Wise Independent Hashing for identifying similar conserved regions. Min-Wise Independent Hashing works by generating a (w,c)-sketch for each document and comparing these sketches. Our algorithm fits well within the MapReduce framework, permitting scalability. We show that coreClust generates results comparable to existing known methods. In particular, we show that the clusters generated by our algorithm capture the subfamilies of the Pfam domain families for which the sequences in a cluster have a similar domain architecture. We show that for a data set of 90,000 sequences (about 250,000 domain regions), the clusters generated by our algorithm give a 75% average weighted F1 score, our accuracy metric, when compared to the clusters generated by a semi-exhaustive pairwise alignment algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The new clustering algorithm can be used to generate meaningful clusters of conserved regions. It is a scalable method that when paired with our prior work, NADDA for detecting conserved regions, provides a complete end-to-end pipeline for annotating protein sequences."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2080-y,""*Algorithms",Amino Acid Sequence,Cluster Analysis,"*Databases, Protein",*Molecular Sequence Annotation,Phylogeny,Protein Domains,Rickettsia/classification,

Computational and mathematical algorithms were developed using clinical outcome data from breast cancer registries, such as Adjuvant! Online and NHS PREDICT. More recently, assessments of molecular profiles have been applied in the development of better prognostic tools. METHODS: Based on the available literature on online registry-based tools and genomic assays, we evaluated whether these online tools could be valid and accurate alternatives to genomic and molecular profiling of the individual breast tumour in aiding therapeutic decisions, particularly in patients with early ER-positive breast cancer.

Raw and processed data from these studies are available on public databases but the opportunity to fully exploit such rich datasets is limited due to the large heterogeneity of data formats. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to effectively integrate gene expression data for analysis and exploration at a broader level. Despite the different goals and approaches towards gene expression data integration, the first step is common to any proposed method: data acquisition. Although it is seemingly straightforward to extract valuable information from a set of downloaded files, things can rapidly get complicated, especially as the number of experiments grows. Transcriptomic datasets are deposited in public databases with little regard to data format and thus retrieving raw data might become a challenging task. While for RNA-seq experiments such problem is partially mitigated by the fact that raw reads are generally available on databases such as the NCBI SRA, for microarray experiments standards are not equally well established, or enforced during submission, and thus a multitude of data formats has emerged. RESULTS: COMMAND>_ is a specialized tool meant to simplify gene expression data acquisition. It is a flexible multi-user web-application that allows users to search and download gene expression experiments, extract only the relevant information from experiment files, re-annotate microarray platforms, and present data in a simple and coherent data model for subsequent analysis. CONCLUSIONS: COMMAND>_ facilitates the creation of local datasets of gene expression data coming from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments and may be a more efficient tool to build integrated gene expression compendia.

Analysis of metabolomics data is a multi-step process that involves data processing, quality control and normalization, followed by statistical and bioinformatics analysis. The latter step often involves pathway analysis to aid biological interpretation of the data. This approach is limited to endogenous metabolites that can be readily mapped to metabolic pathways. An alternative to pathway analysis that can be used for any classes of metabolites, including unknown compounds that are ubiquitous in untargeted metabolomics data, involves defining metabolite-metabolite interactions using experimental data. Our group has developed several network-based methods that use partial correlations of experimentally determined metabolite measurements. These were implemented in CorrelationCalculator and Filigree, two software tools for the analysis of metabolomics data we developed previously. The latter tool implements the Differential Network Enrichment Analysis (DNEA) algorithm. This analysis is useful for building differential networks from metabolomics data containing two experimental groups and identifying differentially enriched metabolic modules. While Filigree is a user-friendly tool, it has certain limitations when used for the analysis of large-scale metabolomics datasets. RESULTS: We developed the DNEA R package for the data-driven network analysis of metabolomics data. We present the DNEA workflow and functionality, algorithm enhancements implemented with respect to the package's predecessor, Filigree, and discuss best practices for analyses. We tested the performance of the DNEA R package and illustrated its features using publicly available metabolomics data from the environmental determinants of diabetes in the young. To our knowledge, this package is the only publicly available tool designed for the construction of biological networks and subsequent enrichment testing for datasets containing exogenous, secondary, and unknown compounds. This greatly expands the scope of traditional enrichment analysis tools that can be used to analyze a relatively small set of well-annotated metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: The DNEA R package is a more flexible and powerful implementation of our previously published software tool, Filigree. The modular structure of the package, along with the parallel processing framework built into the most computationally extensive steps of the algorithm, make it a powerful tool for the analysis of large and complex metabolomics datasets."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-024-05994-1,*Metabolomics/methods",*Software,*Algorithms,Metabolic Networks and Pathways,Computational Biology/methods,"Humans,39695921,PMC11657348",,,

Nevertheless, this methodology requires a second CT scan and planning process when immobilization masks are used in order to fit the bolus under it for treatment. This study investigates the use of a high-grade surface-scanner to produce, prior to the planning CT scan, a 3D-printed bolus in order to increase the workflow efficiency, improve treatment quality and avoid extra radiation dose to the patient. METHODS: The scanner capabilities were tested on a phantom and on volunteers. A phantom was used to produce boluses in the orbital region either from CT data (resolution ?1 mm), or from surface-scanner images (resolution 0.05 mm). Several 3D-printing techniques and materials were tested. To quantify which boluses fit best, they were placed on the phantom and scanned by CT. Hounsfield Unit (HU) profiles were traced perpendicular to the phantom's surface. The minimum HU in the profiles was compared to the HU values for calibrated air-gaps. Boluses were then created from surface images of volunteers to verify the feasibility of surface-scanner use in-vivo. RESULTS: Phantom based tests showed a better fit of boluses modeled from surface-scanner than from CT data. Maximum bolus-to-skin air gaps were 1-2 mm using CT models and always < 0.6 mm using surface-scanner models. Tests on volunteers showed good and comfortable fit of boluses produced from surface-scanner images acquired in 0.6 to 7 min. Even in complex surface regions of the body such as ears and fingers, the high-resolution surface-scanner was able to acquire good models. A breast bolus model generated from images acquired in deep inspiration breath hold was also successful. None of the 3D-printed bolus using surface-scanner models required enlarging or shrinking of the initial model acquired in-vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the material or printing technique, 3D-printed boluses created from high-resolution surface-scanner images proved to be superior in fitting compared to boluses created from CT data. Tests on volunteers were promising, indicating the possibility to improve overall radiotherapy treatments, primarily for megavoltage X-rays, using bolus modeled from a high-resolution surface-scanner even in regions of complex surface anatomy."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13014-018-1148-1,""Computer Simulation",Humans,Neoplasms/*radiotherapy,Organs at Risk/*radiation effects,"*Phantoms, Imaging","Printing, Three-Dimensional/*instrumentation",Radiotherapy Dosage,"Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods",

Several labs have profiled transcripts of myogenic cells during the developmental and adult myogenesis with the aim of identifying quiescent markers. Here, we focused on the quiescent cell state and generated new transcriptome profiles that include subfractionations of adult satellite cell populations, and an artificially induced prenatal quiescent state, to identify core signatures for quiescent and proliferating. METHODS: Comparison of available data offered challenges related to the inherent diversity of datasets and biological conditions. We developed a standardized workflow to homogenize the normalization, filtering, and quality control steps for the analysis of gene expression profiles allowing the identification up- and down-regulated genes and the subsequent gene set enrichment analysis. To share the analytical pipeline of this work, we developed Sherpa, an interactive Shiny server that allows multi-scale comparisons for extraction of desired gene sets from the analyzed datasets. This tool is adaptable to cell populations in other contexts and tissues. RESULTS: A multi-scale analysis comprising eight datasets of quiescent satellite cells had 207 and 542 genes commonly up- and down-regulated, respectively. Shared up-regulated gene sets include an over-representation of the TNFa pathway via NFKß signaling, Il6-Jak-Stat3 signaling, and the apical surface processes, while shared down-regulated gene sets exhibited an over-representation of Myc and E2F targets and genes associated to the G2M checkpoint and oxidative phosphorylation. However, virtually all datasets contained genes that are associated with activation or cell cycle entry, such as the immediate early stress response genes Fos and Jun. An empirical examination of fixed and isolated satellite cells showed that these and other genes were absent in vivo, but activated during procedural isolation of cells. CONCLUSIONS: Through the systematic comparison and individual analysis of diverse transcriptomic profiles, we identified genes that were consistently differentially expressed among the different datasets and shared underlying biological processes key to the quiescent cell state. Our findings provide impetus to define and distinguish transcripts associated with true in vivo quiescence from those that are first responding genes due to disruption of the stem cell niche."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13395-017-0144-8,""Animals",*Cell Differentiation,"Databases, Factual",Female,Gene Expression Profiling,Male,Mice,"Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle/*metabolism",

However, the ability to exploit reasoning on rating scale data is still limited. The objective of this work is to facilitate the integration of the semantics required to automatically interpret collections of standardized clinical data. We developed an electronic prototype for the Scale of the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), broadly used in neurology. In order to address the modeling challenges of the SARA, we propose to combine the best performances from OpenEHR clinical archetypes, guidelines and ontologies. METHODS: A scaled-down version of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) was built, extracting the terms that describe the SARA tests from free-text sources. This version of the HPO was then used as backbone to normalize the content of the SARA through clinical archetypes. The knowledge required to exploit reasoning on the SARA data was modeled as separate information-processing units interconnected via the defined archetypes. Each unit used the most appropriate technology to formally represent the required knowledge. RESULTS: Based on this approach, we implemented a prototype named SARA Management System, to be used for both the assessment of cerebellar syndrome and the production of a clinical synopsis. For validation purposes, we used recorded SARA data from 28 anonymous subjects affected by Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 36 (SCA36). When comparing the performance of our prototype with that of two independent experts, weighted kappa scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of archetypes, phenotype ontologies and electronic information-processing rules can be used to automate the extraction of relevant clinical knowledge from plain scores of rating scales.

However, the associations between lncRNAs and diseases (LDA) still remain unknown in most cases. While identifying disease-related lncRNAs in vivo is costly, computational approaches are promising to not only accelerate the possible identification of associations but also provide clues on the underlying mechanism of various lncRNA-caused diseases. Former computational approaches usually only focus on predicting new associations between lncRNAs having known associations with diseases and other lncRNA-associated diseases. They also only work on binary lncRNA-disease associations (whether the pair has an association or not), which cannot reflect and reveal other biological facts, such as the number of proteins involved in LDA or how strong the association is (i.e., the intensity of LDA). RESULTS: To address abovementioned issues, we propose a graph regression-based unified framework (GRUF). In particular, our method can work on lncRNAs, which have no previously known disease association and diseases that have no known association with any lncRNAs. Also, instead of only a binary answer for the association, our method tries to uncover more biological relationship between a pair of lncRNA and disease, which may provide better clues for researchers. We compared GRUF with three state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrated the superiority of GRUF, which achieves 5%~16% improvement in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). GRUF also provides a predicted confidence score for the predicted LDA, which reveals the significant correlation between the score and the number of RNA-Binding Proteins involved in LDAs. Lastly, three out of top-5 LDA candidates generated by GRUF in novel prediction are verified indirectly by medical literature and known biological facts. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed GRUF has two advantages over existing approaches. Firstly, it can be used to work on lncRNAs that have no known disease association and diseases that have no known association with any lncRNAs. Secondly, instead of providing a binary answer (with or without association), GRUF works for both discrete and continued LDA, which help revealing the pathological implications between lncRNAs and diseases."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12920-017-0305-y,""Algorithms",Computational Biology/methods,Disease/*genetics,Genetic Association Studies,Humans,"RNA, Long Noncoding/chemistry/*physiology","Regression Analysis"",29322937,PMC5763297",,

We aimed to develop and validate a model for predicting HT and its subtypes with poor prognosis-parenchymal hemorrhage (PH), including PH-1 (hematoma within infarcted tissue, occupying < 30%) and PH-2 (hematoma occupying = 30% of the infarcted tissue)-in AIS patients following intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) based on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and clinical data. METHODS: In this six-center retrospective study, clinical and imaging data from 445 consecutive IVT-treated AIS patients were collected (01/2018-06/2023). The training cohort comprised 344 patients from five centers, and the test cohort included 101 patients from the sixth center. A clinical model was developed using eXtreme Gradient Boosting, an NCCT-based imaging model was created using deep learning, and an ensemble model integrated both models. Comparison with existing clinical scores (MSS, SEDAN, GRASPS) was performed using the DeLong test. RESULTS: Of the 445 individuals, 202 (45.4%) had HT, 79 (17.8%) had hemorrhagic infarction, and 123 (27.6%) had PH. In the test cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the clinical, imaging, and ensemble model for HT prediction was 0.877, 0.920, and 0.937, respectively.

Moreover, we implemented a user-friendly web service that allows researchers to upload their own nucleotide sequences in order to perform the whole analysis. Finally, we provided a stand-alone version of StructRNAfinder to be used in large-scale projects. The tool was developed under GNU General Public License (GPLv3) and is freely available at http://structrnafinder.integrativebioinformatics.me . CONCLUSIONS: The main advantage of StructRNAfinder relies on the large-scale processing and integrating the data obtained by each tool and database employed along the workflow, of which several files are generated and displayed in user-friendly reports, useful for downstream analyses and data exploration."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2052-2,Automation",Computational Biology/*methods,*Internet,RNA/chemistry/classification/*genetics,*Software,"Workflow,29454313,PMC5816368",,,

However, information of residue pairing in ß strands could be extracted from a noisy contact map, due to the presence of characteristic contact patterns in ß-ß interactions. This information may benefit the tertiary structure prediction of mainly ß proteins. In this work, we propose a novel ridge-detection-based ß-ß contact predictor to identify residue pairing in ß strands from any predicted residue contact map. RESULTS: Our algorithm RDb(2)C adopts ridge detection, a well-developed technique in computer image processing, to capture consecutive residue contacts, and then utilizes a novel multi-stage random forest framework to integrate the ridge information and additional features for prediction. Starting from the predicted contact map of CCMpred, RDb(2)C remarkably outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on two conventional test sets of ß proteins (BetaSheet916 and BetaSheet1452), and achieves F1-scores of ~ 62% and ~ 76% at the residue level and strand level, respectively. Taking the prediction of the more advanced RaptorX-Contact as input, RDb(2)C achieves impressively higher performance, with F1-scores reaching ~ 76% and ~ 86% at the residue level and strand level, respectively. In a test of structural modeling using the top 1 L predicted contacts as constraints, for 61 mainly ß proteins, the average TM-score achieves 0.442 when using the raw RaptorX-Contact prediction, but increases to 0.506 when using the improved prediction by RDb(2)C. CONCLUSION: Our method can significantly improve the prediction of ß-ß contacts from any predicted residue contact maps. Prediction results of our algorithm could be directly applied to effectively facilitate the practical structure prediction of mainly ß proteins.

RESULTS: We sequenced 192,888 circular consensus sequences (CCS) derived from cDNAs generated using the CloneTech SMARTer system. These SMARTer-SMRT libraries were normalized and size-selected providing a robust population of expressed structural genes for subsequent genome annotation. We demonstrate PacBio mRNA sequences based genome annotation improvement, compared to genome annotation using conventional sequencing-by-synthesis alone, by identifying 1609 (9.2%) new genes, extended the length of 3965 (26.7%) genes and increased the total genomic exon length by 1.9 Mb (12.4%). Non-coding sequence representation (primarily from UTRs based on dT reverse transcription priming) was particularly improved, increasing in total length by fifteen-fold, by increasing both the length and number of UTR exons.

Public Health Emergency (PHE) provisions during the COVID-19 pandemic relaxed in-person evaluation requirements for buprenorphine inductions, allowing for the expansion of telehealth care to OUD populations. This qualitative study explores patients' experiences with a novel digital therapeutic telehealth program with buprenorphine for OUD. METHOD: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a sub-sample (n = 15) of participants from a larger feasibility and acceptability pilot. Interviews explored participants' opioid use, OUD treatment history, previous MOUD experience, barriers to previous treatment attempts, medication adherence, counseling experience, treatment satisfaction, and comparisons between current and previous treatments. RESULTS: Barriers to care in previous OUD treatment episodes included logistical and program related inconveniences (program attendance requirements, commute distances, transportation, appointment wait times, and clinic patient volumes), financial strain, unreliable access to prescribers, residential program experiences, and the availability of detox-only based treatments. Participants with previous treatment experiences contrasted these barriers with the virtual delivery study setting and reported that the characteristics of telehealth OUD care facilitated improved engagement and retention by overcoming many of these barriers through: no transportation requirements, open and flexible appointment scheduling, appointment times confined to care team meetings only, absence of provider availability concerns, and the ability to receive buprenorphine maintenance care from home. The primary barrier noted for virtual care delivery was the fulfillment of buprenorphine prescriptions from local pharmacies. CONCLUSION: A novel digital therapeutic telehealth program was reported to overcome almost all of the barriers encountered by participants during previous traditional OUD treatment episodes, contributing to a growing body of evidence supporting the permanency of current PHE expansions for OUD telehealth care. Findings also emphasize the importance of coming to workable policy solutions for buprenorphine supply threshold constraints on local pharmacies that unintentionally constrict access for telehealth and other OUD patients."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13011-024-00631-9,Humans",*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use,*Telemedicine/organization & administration,*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy,Female,Male,Adult,*Qualitative Research,

The SES is difficult to retrospectively abstract from current electronic medical records and data sets. OBJECTIVE: Using a validated SES measuring tool derived from home address, the HOUsing-based SocioEconomic Status index, termed HOUSES we wanted to determine whether SES is associated with differences in end-of-life care and decision-making. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study utilized a cohort of Olmsted County adult residents admitted to 7 intensive care units (ICUs) at Mayo Rochester between June 1, 2011, and May 31, 2014. MEASUREMENTS: Multiple variables that reflect decision-making and care at end of life and during critical illness were evaluated, including presence of advance directives and discharge disposition. The SES was measured by individual housing-based SES index (HOUSES index"," a composite index derived from real property as a standardized z-score) at the date of admission to the ICU which was then divided into 4 quartiles. The greater HOUSES, the higher SES, outcomes were adjusted for age, 24-hour Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, sex, race/ethnicity, and insurance. RESULTS: Among the eligible 4134 participants, the addresses of 3393 (82%) were successfully geocoded and formulated into HOUSES. The adjusted odds ratios comparing HOUSES 1 versus 2, 3, and 4 demonstrated lower likelihood of advance directives -0.77(95% CI: 0.63-0.93) and lower likelihood of discharge to home -0.60(95% CI: 1.0.5-0.72).

An aligned pattern cluster (APC) can reflect the conserved functionality. Discovering aligned residue associations (ARAs) in APCs can reveal subtle inner working characteristics of conserved regions of protein families. However, ARAs corresponding to different functionalities/subgroups/classes could be entangled because of subtle multiple entwined factors. METHODS: To discover and disentangle patterns from mixed-mode datasets, such as APCs when the residues are replaced by their fundamental biochemical properties list, this paper presents a novel method, Extended Aligned Residual Association Discovery and Disentanglement (E-ARADD). E-ARADD discretizes the numerical dataset to transform the mixed-mode dataset into an event-value dataset, constructs an ARA Frequency Matrix and then converts it into an adjusted Statistical Residual (SR) Vector Space (SRV) capturing statistical deviation from randomness. By applying Principal Component (PC) Decomposition on SRV, PCs ranked by their variance are obtained. Finally, the disentangled ARAs are discovered when the projections on a PC is re-projected to a vector space with the same basis vectors of SRV. RESULTS: Experiments on synthetic, cytochrome c and class A scavenger data have shown that E-ARADD can a) disentangle the entwined ARAs in APCs (with residues or biochemical properties), b) reveal subtle AR clusters relating to classes, subtle subgroups or specific functionalities. CONCLUSIONS: E-ARADD can discover and disentangle ARs and ARAs entangled in functionality and location of protein families to reveal functional subgroups and subgroup characteristics of biological conserved regions. Experimental results on synthetic data provides the proof-of-concept validation on the successful disentanglement that reveals class-associated ARAs with or without class labels as input. Experiments on cytochrome c data proved the efficacy of E-ARADD in handing both types of residue data. Our novel methodology is not only able to discover and disentangle ARs and ARAs in specific statistical/functional (PCs and RSRVs) spaces, but also their locations in the protein family functional domains. The success of E-ARADD shows its great potential to proteomic research, drug discovery and precision and personalized genetic medicine."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12920-018-0417-z,Algorithms",Cluster Analysis,Computational Biology/*methods,Cytochromes c/chemistry/metabolism,"Principal Component Analysis,30453949,PMC6245498",,,,

However, there is little literature describing parental attitudes toward AI in pediatric healthcare, and existing studies do not represent parents of hospitalized children well. METHODS: We administered the Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence in Pediatric Healthcare, a validated survey, to parents of hospitalized children in a single tertiary children's hospital. Surveys were administered by trained study personnel (11/2/2021-5/1/2022). Demographic data were collected. An Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence in Pediatric Healthcare score, assessing openness toward AI-assisted medicine, was calculated for seven areas of concern. Subgroup analyses were conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests to assess the effect of race, gender, education, insurance, length of stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission on AI use. RESULTS: We approached 90 parents and conducted 76 surveys for a response rate of 84%. Overall, parents were open to the use of AI in pediatric medicine. Social justice, convenience, privacy, and shared decision-making were important concerns. Parents of children admitted to an ICU expressed the most significantly different attitudes compared to parents of children not admitted to an ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Parents were overall supportive of AI-assisted healthcare decision-making.

METHODS: In this qualitative research project, we conducted 14 in-depth semistructured interviews with PCPs in a tertiary hospital setting. RESULTS: We identified 4 themes: 1) PCPs describe the EHR as a medicine with side effects, for which they provide suggestions for improvements", 2) A shared record raises ethical questions related to autonomy and trust," 3) Although use of the EHR often disturbs rapport with the patient, it can also support the patient-doctor interaction when it becomes an active part of the conversation"," 4) A shared EHR may cause health care providers (and their relatives) to avoid seeking help for sensitive issues. DISCUSSION: PCPs fear access to results could cause confusion and anxiety in patients, resulting in tensions between autonomy and beneficence. Improved efficiency and quality of care with a shared EHR relies on doctors trusting each other's input to avoid duplicate tests. However, this might compromise a fundamental skeptical attitude in practicing medicine, and we should be aware of a risk of increased confirmation and anchoring bias. CONCLUSION: The EHR is considered to be a work in progress-EHR design could be improved by examining physicians' coping strategies and implementing their suggestions for improvement.

A prevailing approach to detecting differentially co-expressed genes is to compare Pearson's correlation coefficients in two phenotypes. However, due to the limitations of Pearson's correlation measure, this approach lacks the power to detect nonlinear changes in gene co-expression which is common in gene regulatory networks. RESULTS: In this work, a new nonparametric procedure is proposed to search differentially co-expressed gene pairs in different phenotypes from large-scale data. Our computational pipeline consisted of two main steps, a screening step and a testing step. The screening step is to reduce the search space by filtering out all the independent gene pairs using distance correlation measure. In the testing step, we compare the gene co-expression patterns in different phenotypes by a recently developed edge-count test. Both steps are distribution-free and targeting nonlinear relations. We illustrate the promise of the new approach by analyzing the Cancer Genome Atlas data and the METABRIC data for breast cancer subtypes.

Bioinformatical analysis of these data commonly requires a number of mutually dependent steps applied to numerous samples for multiple conditions and replicates. To support these analyses, a number of workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to allow automated execution of corresponding analysis workflows. Major advantages of WMSs are the easy reproducibility of results as well as the reusability of workflows or their components. RESULTS: In this article, we present Watchdog, a WMS for the automated analysis of large-scale experimental data. Main features include straightforward processing of replicate data, support for distributed computer systems, customizable error detection and manual intervention into workflow execution. Watchdog is implemented in Java and thus platform-independent and allows easy sharing of workflows and corresponding program modules. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for workflow construction using pre-defined modules as well as a helper script for creating new module definitions. Execution of workflows is possible using either the GUI or a command-line interface and a web-interface is provided for monitoring the execution status and intervening in case of errors. To illustrate its potentials on a real-life example, a comprehensive workflow and modules for the analysis of RNA-seq experiments were implemented and are provided with the software in addition to simple test examples. CONCLUSIONS: Watchdog is a powerful and flexible WMS for the analysis of large-scale high-throughput experiments.

From 2010 to 15, Micronutrient Initiative (MI), worked with the public sector in Bihar, India to enable community health workers to treat and report uncomplicated child diarrhoea with ORS and zinc. We describe how we estimated programme's impact on child mortality with Lives Saved Tool (LiST) modelling and data from MI's management information system (MIS). This study demonstrates that using LiST modelling and MIS data are viable options for evaluating programmes to reduce child mortality. METHODS: We used MI's programme monitoring data to estimate coverage rates and LiST modelling software to estimate programme impact on child mortality. Four scenarios estimated the effects of different rates of programme scale-up and programme coverage on estimated child mortality by measuring children's lives saved. RESULTS: The programme saved an estimated 806-975 children under-5 who had diarrhoea during five-year project phase. Increasing ORS and zinc coverage rates to 19.8% & 18.3% respectively under public sector coverage with effective treatment would have increased the programme's impact on child mortality and could have achieved the project goal of saving 4200 children's lives during the five-year programme. CONCLUSIONS: Programme monitoring data can be used with LiST modelling software to estimate coverage rates and programme impact on child mortality. This modelling approach may cost less and yield estimates sooner than directly measuring programme impact with population-based surveys. However, users must be cautious about relying on modelled estimates of impact and ensure that the programme monitoring data used is complete and precise about the programme aspects that are modelled. Otherwise, LiST may mis-estimate impact on child mortality. Further, LiST software may require modifications to its built-in assumptions to capture programmatic inputs. LiST assumes that mortality rates and cause of death structure change only in response to changes in programme coverage. In Bihar, overall child mortality has decreased and diarrhoea seems to be less lethal than previously, but at present LiST does not adjust its estimates for these sorts of changes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12889-017-5008-y,""Administration, Oral",Child Mortality/*trends,"Child, Preschool",Diarrhea/mortality/*prevention & control,Humans,India/epidemiology,Infant,"Models, Theoretical",

RESEARCH QUESTION: How do health care purchasing professionals integrate equity concerns into purchasing decision-making? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Between August 2023 and March 2024, we conducted semistructured interviews via videoconferencing with health care purchasing professionals about purchasing processes for pulse oximeters and other devices-and whether and where equity concerns arise in decision-making. An abductive approach was used to analyze perspectives on how equity and disparity concerns currently are integrated into health care purchasing decision-making. Health care purchasing professionals (N = 30) worked in varied supply chain roles for various health systems and supply chain support and consulting companies across the United States. RESULTS: Health care purchasing professionals described limited considerations of equity in current purchasing processes. They described some receptivity to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, largely focused on diversifying suppliers rather than ensuring that devices and products functioned equitably. Respondents reported that they depended on clinician partners to raise and delineate requirements for equitable performance. Respondents also depicted current sources of evidence used in making purchasing decisions as providing limited information about equitable performance and that large contracts, including with group purchasing organizations, may limit purchasing options. INTERPRETATION: Health system purchasing professionals suggested interest and some nascent successes in diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations in health system purchasing processes, including diverse supplier initiatives, but also expressed a need for strong clinical partnership to ensure equitable performance.

Then, the dosimetric differences caused by motion were analyzed. METHODS: Thirty-two UCC patients were included. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained before and after each treatment. The maximum and average shifts in the centroid of the target volume and OARs along the anterior/posterior (A/P: Y axes), cranial/caudal (Cr/C: Z axes), and right/left (R/L: X axes) directions were analyzed through image contours. The bladder wall deformation in six directions and the differences in the volume of the organs were also analyzed. Additionally, the motion of the upper, middle and lower rectum was quantified. The correlation between OAR displacement/deformation and target volume displacement was evaluated. The planning CT dose distribution was mapped to the MR image to generate a plan based on the new anatomy, and the dosimetric differences caused by motion were analyzed. RESULTS: For intrafraction motion, the clinical tumor volume (CTV) range of motion along the XYZ axes was within 5 mm"," for interfraction motion, the range of motion along the X axis was within 5 mm, and the maximum distances of motion along the Y axis and Z axis were 7.45 and 6.59 mm, respectively. Additionally, deformation of the superior and anterior walls of the bladder was most noticeable. The largest magnitude of motion was observed in the upper segment of the rectum. Posterior bladder wall displacement was correlated with rectal and CTV centroid Y-axis displacement (r = 0.63, r = 0.50, P < 0.05). Compared with the interfractional plan, a significant decrease in the planning target volume (PTV) D98 (7.5 Gy, 7.54 Gy) was observed. However, there were no significant differences within the intrafraction. CONCLUSION: During ART for UCC patients using MR-Linac, we recommend an ATS workflow using isotropic PTV margins of 5 mm based on intrafraction motion. Based on interfraction motion, the recommended ATP workflow uses anisotropic PTV margins of 5 mm in the R/L direction, 8 mm in the A/P direction, and 7 mm in the Cr/C direction to compensate for dosimetric errors due to motion."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13014-024-02569-5,""Humans",*Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/radiotherapy/diagnostic imaging/pathology,Female,"*Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/methods",*Organs at Risk/radiation effects,*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods,*Radiotherapy Dosage,

Radiomics, particularly of the spleen, may improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies. External validations are necessary to ensure reliability and generalizability. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we developed 3 radiomics models using contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans from 167 patients with liver fibrosis (training group) between January 2020 and December 2021. Radiomic features were extracted from arterial venous, portal venous, and equilibrium phase images. Recursive feature selection random forest and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression were used for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. Performance was assessed by area under the curve, C-index, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. External validation was performed on 114 patients from 2 institutions. RESULTS: Twenty-five radiomic features were significantly associated with fibrosis stage, with 80% of the top 10 features originating from portal venous phase spleen images. The radiomics models showed good performance in the validation cohort (C-indices 0.723-0.808) and excellent calibration. Decision curve analysis indicated clinical benefits, with machine learning-based radiomics models (Random Forest score and support vector machine based radiomics score) providing more significant advantages. DISCUSSION: Radiomic features offer significant benefits over existing serum indices for staging virus-driven liver fibrosis, underscoring the value of radiomics in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, radiomics analysis of the spleen presents additional noninvasive options for assessing fibrosis, highlighting its potential in improving patient management and outcomes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.14309/ctg.0000000000000712,""Humans",*Liver Cirrhosis/diagnostic imaging/virology/pathology,Male,Female,Retrospective Studies,Middle Aged,"*Tomography, X-Ray Computed",*Contrast Media,

This project aimed to undertake systematic data linkage to identify and invite eligible Maori women to participate in breast screening. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in Northern New Zealand between 1/01/2020 and 30/06/2021. The BreastScreen Aotearoa (BSA) register was linked with the primary care data to identify and invite eligible Maori women (aged 45-69 years) to breast screening, who were not currently enrolled in BSA, and who were enrolled in BSA but had not been screened or overdue for breast screening. Invitations were sent through invitation letters, text messages and phone calls. Enrolment to BSA and screening participation at 15 and 18 months from the project's start date were reported. RESULTS: Through the data linkage, 2295 women who were not enrolled in BSA were identified eligible for breast screening. Approximately half (n = 1086) of the women were contactable within 5 contact attempts. Of these contactable, 345 (32%) women were enrolled in BSA, 421 (39%) were screened at 15 months, increasing to 441 (41%) at 18 months from the project start. Among women who were previously enrolled but never screened or overdue for screening, 1470 women were eligible. Their contact details were updated through the data linkage, which facilitated BSA to contact them successfully for breast screening. Consequently, 305 (21%) of these eligible were screened at 15 months, and increased to 332 (23%) at 18 months.

Numerous video denoising methods have been proposed to remove noise while preserving texture details. However, existing methods still suffer from the following problems: (1) relevant temporal features in the low-contrast ultrasound video cannot be accurately aligned and effectively aggregated by simple optical flow or motion estimation, resulting in the artifacts and motion blur in the video"," (2) fixed receptive field in spatial features integration lacks the flexibility of aggregating features in the global region of interest and is susceptible to interference from irrelevant noisy regions. In this work, we propose a deformable spatial-temporal attention denoising network to remove speckle noise in thyroid ultrasound video. The entire network follows the bidirectional feature propagation mechanism to efficiently exploit the spatial-temporal information of the whole video sequence. In this process, two modules are proposed to address the above problems: (1) a deformable temporal attention module (DTAM) is designed after optical flow pre-alignment to further capture and aggregate relevant temporal features according to the learned offsets between frames, so that inter-frame information can be better exploited even with the imprecise flow estimation under the low contrast of ultrasound video"," (2) a deformable spatial attention module (DSAM) is proposed to flexibly integrate spatial features in the global region of interest through the learned intra-frame offsets, so that irrelevant noisy information can be ignored and essential information can be precisely exploited. Finally, all these refined features are rectified and merged through residual convolution blocks to recover the clean video frames. Experimental results on our thyroid ultrasound video (US-V) dataset and the DDTI dataset demonstrate that our proposed method exceeds 1.2  ~  1.3 dB on PSNR and has clearer texture detail compared to other state-of-the-art methods. In the meantime, the proposed model can also assist thyroid nodule segmentation methods to achieve more accurate segmentation effect, which provides an important basis for thyroid diagnosis. In the future, the proposed model can be improved and extended to other medical image sequence datasets, including CT and MRI slice denoising.

Endoscopy and surgery are the standard treatments for localized tumors, but multimodal treatments, associated chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are needed for the vast majority of patients who present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Although survival has improved, most patients still present with advanced disease at diagnosis. In addition, most patients exhibit a poor or incomplete response to treatment, experience early recurrence and have an impaired quality of life. Compared with several other cancers, the therapeutic approach is not personalized, and research is much less developed. It is, therefore, urgent to hasten the development of research protocols, and consequently, develop a large, ambitious and innovative tool through which future scientific questions may be answered. This research must be patient-related so that rapid feedback to the bedside is achieved and should aim to identify clinical-, biological- and tumor-related factors that are associated with treatment resistance. Finally, this research should also seek to explain epidemiological and social facets of disease behavior. METHODS: The prospective FREGAT database, established by the French National Cancer Institute, is focused on adult patients with carcinomas of the esophagus and stomach and on whatever might be the tumor stage or therapeutic strategy. The database includes epidemiological, clinical, and tumor characteristics data as well as follow-up, human and social sciences quality of life data, along with a tumor and serum bank. DISCUSSION: This innovative method of research will allow for the banking of millions of data for the development of excellent basic, translational and clinical research programs for esophageal and gastric cancer. This will ultimately improve general knowledge of these diseases, therapeutic strategies and patient survival.

We aim to develop a pipeline that can be trained using readily accessible binary image-level classification labels, to effectively segment regions of interest without requiring ground truth annotations. METHODS: This work proposes the use of a deep superpixel generation model and a deep superpixel clustering model trained simultaneously to output weakly supervised brain tumor segmentations. The superpixel generation model's output is selected and clustered together by the superpixel clustering model. Additionally, we train a classifier using binary image-level labels (i.e., labels indicating whether an image contains a tumor), which is used to guide the training by localizing undersegmented seeds as a loss term. The proposed simultaneous use of superpixel generation and clustering models, and the guided localization approach allow for the output weakly supervised tumor segmentations to capture contextual information that is propagated to both models during training, resulting in superpixels that specifically contour the tumors. We evaluate the performance of the pipeline using Dice coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95) and compare the performance to state-of-the-art baselines. These baselines include the state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation method using both seeds and superpixels (CAM-S), and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). RESULTS: We used 2D slices of magnetic resonance brain scans from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2020 dataset and labels indicating the presence of tumors to train and evaluate the pipeline.

Traditional prediction methods relying on demographic and genetic data often fall short in accuracy and robustness. Recent graph-based models, while promising, frequently neglect the critical role of atomic interactions and fail to integrate drug fingerprints with SMILES for comprehensive molecular graph construction. RESULTS: We introduce multimodal multi-channel graph attention network with adaptive fusion (MGATAF), a framework designed to enhance drug response predictions by capturing both local and global interactions among graph nodes. MGATAF improves drug representation by integrating SMILES and fingerprints, resulting in more precise predictions of drug effects. The methodology involves constructing multimodal molecular graphs, employing multi-channel graph attention networks to capture diverse interactions, and using adaptive fusion to integrate these interactions at multiple abstraction levels. Empirical results demonstrate MGATAF's superior performance compared to traditional and other graph-based techniques. For example, on the GDSC dataset, MGATAF achieved a 5.12% improvement in the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), reaching 0.9312 with an RMSE of 0.0225. Similarly, in new cell-line tests, MGATAF outperformed baselines with a PCC of 0.8536 and an RMSE of 0.0321 on the GDSC dataset, and a PCC of 0.7364 with an RMSE of 0.0531 on the CCLE dataset. CONCLUSIONS: MGATAF significantly advances drug response prediction by effectively integrating multiple molecular data types and capturing complex interactions. This framework enhances prediction accuracy and offers a robust tool for personalized medicine, potentially leading to more effective and safer treatments for patients.

Filtering steps include the use of population variation datasets to remove inherited variants as well a subset of normal samples to remove technical artifacts. We then directly compare mutation detection with tumor-only and tumor-normal approaches using the same sets of samples. Comparisons are performed using an internal targeted gene sequencing dataset (n = 3380) as well as whole exome sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project (n = 250). Tumor-only mutation detection shows similar recall (43-60%) but lesser precision (20-21%) to current matched tumor/normal approaches (recall 43-73%, precision 30-82%) when compared to a """"gold-standard"""" tumor/normal approach. The inclusion of a small pool of normal samples improves precision, although many variants are still uniquely detected in the tumor-only analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A detailed method for somatic mutation detection without matched normal samples enables study of larger numbers of tumor samples, as well as tumor samples for which a matched normal is not available. As sensitivity/recall is similar to tumor/normal mutation detection but precision is lower, tumor-only detection is more appropriate for classification of samples based on known mutations. Although matched tumor-normal analysis is preferred due to higher precision, we demonstrate that mutation detection without matched normal samples is possible for certain applications."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40246-017-0118-2,""DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods","Databases, Factual",Genotype,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods,Humans,Mutation,Neoplasms/*genetics,

This study examines how different economic mechanisms affected low self-rated health (SRH) in Europe over the crisis period (2008-2011). We measure changes in low SRH over 2008-2011 and analyze how they are accounted for by changes in household income levels and income distribution (income poverty, income inequality), labour market developments (increasing unemployment, falling employment, changes in labour market inactivity), and non-income poverty (material deprivation). METHODS: We use balanced panel data for 2008-2011 covering 26 European countries and 43,456 participants. The data come from longitudinal 2011 European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) database. Increases in low SRH incidence over time are decomposed into the contributions of changes in the distribution of covariates and changes in returns to the covariates. Main covariates include household income and its distribution, labour market developments, and non-income poverty (material deprivation). The decompositions are performed using a detailed non-linear multivariate regression-based decomposition methodology. RESULTS: Low SRH incidence increased in Europe during the crisis by almost 2 percentage points, and by 3.7 percentage points in case of the Baltic countries. Decomposition analysis shows that: 1) decreasing household incomes and changing income distribution had no impact on low SRH incidence, 2) rise of material deprivation accounts for a significant portion (12%) of the overall growth in low SRH rates (27% for the Baltic countries), 3) decreasing levels of full-time and part-time employment as well as transitions to unemployment, economic inactivity, disability, or retirement account jointly for about 21% of the rise in low SRH in Europe (73% for Baltic countries). CONCLUSION: Together, the recession-related economic factors account for about 33% of the increase in low SRH incidence in Europe during the crisis, and for about 100% of the increase in the Baltic countries. Public health policy during recessions should focus also on reducing material deprivation through free or subsidized access to public services, public housing, and other means."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12939-019-0926-1,""Adult",Algorithms,"Databases, Factual",*Economic Recession,European Union,Female,*Health Status,Humans,

We propose an approach to assess comorbidities burden for a specific disease using the literature and EHR data sources in the case of autoimmune diseases in celiac disease (CD). METHODS: We generated a restricted set of comorbidities using the literature (via the MeSH® co-occurrence file). We extracted the 15 most co-occurring autoimmune diseases of the CD. We used mappings of the comorbidities to EHR terminologies: ICD-10 (billing codes), ATC (drugs) and UMLS (clinical reports). Finally, we extracted the concepts from the different data sources. We evaluated our approach using the correlation between prevalence estimates in our cohort and co-occurrence ranking in the literature. RESULTS: We retrieved the comorbidities for 741 patients with CD. 18.1% of patients had at least one of the 15 studied autoimmune disorders. Overall, 79.3% of the mapped concepts were detected only in text, 5.3% only in ICD codes and/or drugs prescriptions, and 15.4% could be found in both sources. Prevalence in our cohort were correlated with literature (Spearman's coefficient 0.789, p = 0.0005). The three most prevalent comorbidities were thyroiditis 12.6% (95% CI 10.1-14.9), type 1 diabetes 2.3% (95% CI 1.2-3.4) and dermatitis herpetiformis 2.0% (95% CI 1.0-3.0).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This local ethics committee-approved study utilized a public dataset (train/test 179/39 subjects, 137 female), a German National Cohort (NAKO) subset (train/test 1412/65 subjects, mean age 53, 694 female), and an in-house dataset (test 10 subjects, mean age 70, 5 female). SPINEPS is a semantic segmentation model, followed by a sliding window approach utilizing a second model to create instance masks from the semantic ones. Segmentation evaluation metrics included the Dice score and average symmetrical surface distance (ASSD). Statistical significance was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: On the public dataset, SPINEPS outperformed a nnUNet baseline on every structure and metric (e.g., an average over vertebra instances: dice 0.933 vs 0.911, p < 0.001, ASSD 0.21 vs 0.435, p < 0.001). SPINEPS trained on automated annotations of the NAKO achieves an average global Dice score of 0.918 on the combined NAKO and in-house test split. Adding the training data from the public dataset outperforms this (average instance-wise Dice score over the vertebra substructures 0.803 vs 0.778, average global Dice score 0.931 vs 0.918). CONCLUSION: SPINEPS offers segmentation of 14 spinal structures in T2w sagittal images. It provides a semantic mask and an instance mask separating the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. This is the first publicly available algorithm to enable this segmentation. KEY POINTS: Question No publicly available automatic approach can yield semantic and instance segmentation masks for the whole spine (including posterior elements) in T2-weighted sagittal TSE images. Findings Segmenting semantically first and then instance-wise outperforms a baseline trained directly on instance segmentation. The developed model produces high-resolution MRI segmentations for the whole spine.

However, when confronted with limited data, these networks face a critical vulnerability, often succumbing to overfitting by excessively memorizing the limited information available. This work addresses the challenge mentioned above by improving the supervised contrastive learning method leveraging both image-level labels and domain-specific augmentations to enhance model robustness. This approach integrates self-supervised pre-training with a two-stage supervised contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage, we employ a modified supervised contrastive loss that not only focuses on reducing false negatives but also introduces an elimination effect to address false positives. In the second stage, a relaxing mechanism is introduced that refines positive and negative pairs based on similarity, ensuring that only relevant image representations are aligned. We evaluate our method on the BreakHis dataset, which consists of breast cancer histopathology images, and demonstrate an increase in classification accuracy by 1.45% in the image level, compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Determining thyroid nodule contours is necessary for the calculation of TIRADS scores and can also be used in the development of machine learning nodule diagnosis systems. This paper presents the development, validation, and multi-institutional independent testing of a machine learning system for the automatic segmentation of thyroid nodules on ultrasound. METHODS: The datasets, containing a total of 1595 thyroid ultrasound images from 520 patients with thyroid nodules, were retrospectively collected under IRB approval from University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) and Weill Cornell Medical Center (WCMC). Nodules were manually contoured by a team of UCM and WCMC physicians for ground truth. An AttU-Net, a U-Net architecture with additional attention weighting functions, was trained for the segmentations. The algorithm was validated through fivefold cross-validation by nodule and was tested on two independent test sets: one from UCM and one from WCMC. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and percent Hausdorff distance (%HD), Hausdorff distance reported as a percent of the nodule's effective diameter, served as the performance metrics. RESULTS: On multi-institutional independent testing, the AttU-Net yielded average DSCs (std. deviation) of 0.915 (0.04) and 0.922 (0.03) and %HDs (std. deviation) of 12.9% (4.6) and 13.4% (6.3) on the UCM and WCMC test sets, respectively. Similarity testing showed the algorithm's performance on the two institutional test sets was equivalent up to margins of ? DSC  =  0.013 and ? %HD  =  1.73%.

The enablers and barriers, outputs from the CFIR-ERIC matching tool and the BCW were used to develop a prototype of the content and interactive logic within a digital tool. The prototype was refined following feedback from intended users (n = 7) at three design workshops. RESULTS: Programme theory was developed and refined following feedback from intended users of SITAS. Twenty-three enablers and barriers were prioritised. CFIR was identified as the best fit framework with the majority of enablers and barriers (n = 15) mapped to the 'Inner Setting' domain.

As many fungal species cannot be cultured, morphological identification of those species is almost impossible. But, DNA barcoding technique can be employed for identification of such species. For fungal taxonomy prediction, the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) region of rDNA (ribosomal DNA) is used as barcode. Though the computational prediction of fungal species has become feasible with the availability of huge volume of barcode sequences in public domain, prediction of fungal species is challenging due to high degree of variability among ITS regions within species. RESULTS: A Random Forest (RF)-based predictor was built for identification of unknown fungal species. The reference and query sequences were mapped onto numeric features based on gapped base pair compositions, and then used as training and test sets respectively for prediction of fungal species using RF. More than 85% accuracy was found when 4 sequences per species in the reference set were utilized"," whereas it was seen to be stabilized at ~88% if =7 sequence per species in the reference set were used for training of the model.

They are reported to play important roles in development, differentiation and innate immunity. However, miRNAs in Anopheles sinensis, one of the Chinese malaria mosquitoes, remain largely unknown. METHODS: We investigated the global miRNA expression profile of An. sinensis using Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing. Meanwhile, we applied a bioinformatic approach to identify potential miRNAs in An. sinensis. The identified miRNA profiles were compared and analyzed by two approaches. The selected miRNAs from the sequencing result and the bioinformatic approach were confirmed with qRT-PCR. Moreover, target prediction, GO annotation and pathway analysis were carried out to understand the role of miRNAs in An. sinensis. RESULTS: We identified 49 conserved miRNAs and 12 novel miRNAs by next-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. In contrast, 43 miRNAs were predicted by the bioinformatic approach, of which two were assigned as novel. Comparative analysis of miRNA profiles by two approaches showed that 21 miRNAs were shared between them. Twelve novel miRNAs did not match any known miRNAs of any organism, indicating that they are possibly species-specific. Forty miRNAs were found in many mosquito species, indicating that these miRNAs are evolutionally conserved and may have critical roles in the process of life. Both the selected known and novel miRNAs (asi-miR-281, asi-miR-184, asi-miR-14, asi-miR-nov5, asi-miR-nov4, asi-miR-9383, and asi-miR-2a) could be detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the sequenced sample, and the expression patterns of these miRNAs measured by qRT-PCR were in concordance with the original miRNA sequencing data. The predicted targets for the known and the novel miRNAs covered many important biological roles and pathways indicating the diversity of miRNA functions. We also found 21 conserved miRNAs and eight counterparts of target immune pathway genes in An. sinensis based on the analysis of An. gambiae. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first lead to the elucidation of the miRNA profile in An. sinensis. Unveiling the roles of mosquito miRNAs will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of mosquito biology and mosquito-pathogen interactions.

However, considering the plethora of single and review studies published to date, maintaining a comprehensive overview of digital technologies' impact on nursing and effectively utilizing available evidence is challenging. OBJECTIVE: This review aims (i) to map published reviews on digital nursing technologies, based on their aims and the specific technologies investigated, to synthesize evidence on how these technologies' uses is associated with (ii) nurses' work-related and organizational factors, professional behavior, and health and work safety and (iii) ethically relevant outcomes for people in need of care. DESIGN: Preregistered overview of reviews (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42023389751). SETTING(S): We searched for systematic reviews in eight databases, five key journals, and reference lists of included reviews published in English until May 21, 2024. METHODS: We used the AMSTAR 2 checklist to assess the methodological quality of included reviews reporting associations with nursing outcomes. The extracted data were analyzed by their frequency and narratively synthesized. RESULTS: We identified 213 reviews on digital technologies' uses in the nursing sector. Most of these focused on information and communication technologies. The most frequently reported research objectives encompass technology usage and/or general experiences with it and technology-related consequences for care recipients. Regarding work-related and organizational factors, beneficial impacts were found for the execution of nursing tasks, information management and job control. Depending on the technology type, reviews reported mixed effects for documentation activities, communication/collaboration and mainly negative effects on nurses' workload. Concerning occupational safety and health-related and further nurse outcomes, reviews reported mostly positive effects on nurses' job satisfaction and professional competence. Adverse effects related to mental and physical strain, such as increased frustration, fatigue, and burnout. Regarding ethically relevant outcomes, robotic and telecare technologies had the most reported findings. Most evidence concerned effects on the principles of beneficence/non-maleficence and respect for autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: Digital nursing technologies' legitimacy hinges on their impact on patient outcomes and nurses' work, safety, and health. This review identifies a diverse array of these technologies, with both positive and negative effects. However, due to narrative limitations, meta-analysis was impractical.

An increasing availability of microbiome DNA sequencing data provides an opportunity to infer gene function in a systematic manner. RESULTS: We evaluated if the evolutionary signal contained in metagenome phyletic profiles (MPP) is predictive of a broad array of gene functions. The MPPs are an encoding of environmental DNA sequencing data that consists of relative abundances of gene families across metagenomes. We find that such MPPs can accurately predict 826 Gene Ontology functional categories, while drawing on human gut microbiomes, ocean metagenomes, and DNA sequences from various other engineered and natural environments. Overall, in this task, the MPPs are highly accurate, and moreover they provide coverage for a set of Gene Ontology terms largely complementary to standard phylogenetic profiles, derived from fully sequenced genomes. We also find that metagenomes approximated from taxon relative abundance obtained via 16S rRNA gene sequencing may provide surprisingly useful predictive models. Crucially, the MPPs derived from different types of environments can infer distinct, non-overlapping sets of gene functions and therefore complement each other. Consistently, simulations on > 5000 metagenomes indicate that the amount of data is not in itself critical for maximizing predictive accuracy, while the diversity of sampled environments appears to be the critical factor for obtaining robust models. CONCLUSIONS: In past work, metagenomics has provided invaluable insight into ecology of various habitats, into diversity of microbial life and also into human health and disease mechanisms. We propose that environmental DNA sequencing additionally constitutes a useful tool to predict biological roles of genes, yielding inferences out of reach for existing comparative genomics approaches."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40168-018-0506-4,""Evolution, Molecular",Gene Ontology,Genomics,Humans,Metagenomics/*methods,*Multigene Family,Phylogeny,"RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics",

This study sought to investigate the degree to which children's predisposition to eat upon exposure to food environment and food cues (external eating), could explain differences in strength of associations between their food consumption and the type of food outlets and marketing strategies present in their neighborhood. METHODS: Data were obtained from 616 6-12 y.o. children recruited into a population-based cross-sectional study in which food consumption was measured through a 24-h food recall and responsiveness to food cues measured using the external eating scale. The proportion of food retailers within 3 km of residence considered as """"healthful"""" was calculated using a Geographical Information System. Neighborhood exposure to food marketing strategies (displays, discount frequency, variety, and price) for vegetables and soft drinks were derived from a geocoded digital marketing database. Adjusted mixed models with spatial covariance tested interaction effects of food environment indicators and external eating on food consumption. RESULTS: In children with higher external eating scores, healthful food consumption was more positively related to vegetable displays, and more negatively to the display and variety of soft drinks. No interactions were observed for unhealthful food consumption and no main effects of food environment indicators were found on food consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Children differ in their responsiveness to marketing-related visual food cues on the basis of their external eating phenotype. Strategies aiming to increase the promotion of healthful relative to unhealthful food products in stores may be particularly beneficial for children identified as being more responsive to food cues."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12966-017-0540-9,Carbonated Beverages",Child,Commerce,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Cues,*Diet,*Eating,Environment,

The digital transformation will undoubtedly affect today's medical students. This study focuses on trust from the perspective of three groups of medical students - students from Croatia, students from Slovakia, and international students studying in Slovakia. METHODS: A paper-pen survey was conducted using a non-probabilistic convenience sample. In the second half of 2022, 1715 students were surveyed at five faculties in Croatia and three in Slovakia. RESULTS: Specifically, 38.2% of students indicated familiarity with the concept of AI, while 44.8% believed they would use AI in the future. Patient readiness for the implementation of technologies was mostly assessed as being low. More than half of the students, 59.1%, believe that the implementation of digital technology (AI) will negatively impact the patient-physician relationship and 51,3% of students believe that patients will trust physicians less. The least agreement with the statement was observed among international students, while a higher agreement was expressed by Slovak and Croatian students 40.9% of Croatian students believe that users do not trust the healthcare system, 56.9% of Slovak students agree with this view, while only 17.3% of international students share this opinion. The ability to explain to patients how AI works if they were asked was statistically significantly different for the different student groups, international students expressed the lowest agreement, while the Slovak and Croatian students showed a higher agreement. CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into medical students' attitudes from Croatia, Slovakia, and international students regarding the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the future healthcare system, with a particular emphasis on the concept of trust. A notable difference was observed between the three groups of students, with international students differing from their Croatian and Slovak colleagues.

However, the lack of data on prescribing trends in initial pharmacotherapy in primary care hinders the understanding of how scientific and technical developments impact patient care and may also perpetuate suboptimal practices. Hence, this study aims to analyze trends in the initial pharmacological treatment of newly diagnosed COPD patients in Dutch primary care from 2010 to 2021. METHODS: A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted via the PHARMO GP Database. Data were extracted from the electronic health records of individuals managed by general practitioners in the Netherlands within the PHARMO Data Network. Individuals aged = 40 years at diagnosis with an International Classification of Primary Care code for COPD (R95) were included. Initial pharmacological treatment was identified based on the first prescription issued within 90 days postdiagnosis. The annual proportions of individuals receiving a specific treatment among those diagnosed were calculated and directly standardized by age and sex according to the 2021 Dutch population structure. Trend analysis was performed via joinpoint regression. RESULTS: A total of 54,628 COPD patients were included (median [IQR] age: 65 [57-73]"," 53.7% male), with 36.4% not receiving respiratory medication within 90 days of diagnosis, and 4.2% on other treatments. Trend analysis revealed that LAMA monotherapy increased from 13.4% in 2010 to 15.1% in 2015 and then declined to 11.0% by 2021. Moreover, LABA-ICS decreased from 17.6% to 8.5% between 2010 and 2018, after which it plateaued. In contrast, LABA-LAMA sharply increased, from 0.6% in 2010 to 9.6% in 2021. LABA monotherapy increased from 2.6% in 2010 to 5.7% in 2021. Triple therapy has remained constant. For reliever-only therapies, SABA increased from 8.5% in 2010 to 14.3% in 2018 and then stabilized, whereas SAMA and SABA-SAMA remained low throughout. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in initial pharmacological COPD treatment from 2010 to 2021 likely reflect the introduction of new inhalers and updated management strategies.

Some lncRNAs have been confirmed that they play an important role in the process of development through the dosage compensation effect, epigenetic regulation, cell differentiation regulation and other aspects. However, the majority of the lncRNAs have not been functionally characterized. Explore the function of lncRNAs and the regulatory network has become a hot research topic currently. METHODS: In the work, a network-based model named BiRWLGO is developed. The ultimate goal is to predict the probable functions for lncRNAs at large scale. The new model starts with building a global network composed of three networks: lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. After that, it utilizes bi-random walk algorithm to explore the similarities between lncRNAs and proteins. Finally, we can annotate an lncRNA with the Gene Ontology (GO) terms according to its neighboring proteins. RESULTS: We compare the performance of BiRWLGO with the state-of-the-art models on a manually annotated lncRNA benchmark with known GO terms. The experimental results assert that BiRWLGO outperforms other methods in terms of both maximum F-measure (F(max)) and coverage. CONCLUSIONS: BiRWLGO is a relatively efficient method to predict the functions of lncRNA.

However, the literature on specific phobias is scarce, and, as far as we know, there are no studies on Flying Phobia (FP). This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an Internet-based exposure treatment for FP (NO-FEAR Airlines) that includes exposure scenarios composed of images and sounds, versus a waiting-list control group. A secondary aim is to explore two ways of delivering NO-FEAR Airlines, with and without therapist guidance. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in which 69 participants were allocated to: 1) NO-FEAR Airlines totally self-applied, 2) NO-FEAR Airlines with therapist guidance, 3) a waiting-list control group. Primary outcome measures were the Fear of Flying Questionnaire-II and the Fear of Flying Scale. Secondary outcomes included the Fear and Avoidance Scales, Clinician Severity Scale, and Patient's Improvement scale. Behavioral outcomes (post-treatment flights and safety behaviors) were also included. Mixed-model analyses with no ad hoc imputations were conducted for primary and secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: NO-FEAR Airlines (with and without therapist guidance) was significantly effective, compared to the waiting list control group, on all primary and secondary outcomes (all ps < .05), and no significant differences were found between the two ways of delivering the intervention. Significant improvements on diagnostic status and reliable change indexes were also found in both treatment groups at post-treatment. Regarding behavioral outcomes, significant differences in safety behaviors were found at post-treatment, compared to the waiting list. Treatment gains were maintained at 3- and 12-month follow-ups. CONCLUSION: FP can be treated effectively via the Internet. NO-FEAR Airlines helps to enhance the exposure technique and provide access to evidence-based psychological treatment to more people in need. These data are congruent with previous studies highlighting the usefulness of computer-assisted exposure programs for FP, and they contribute to the literature on Internet-based interventions.

However, the application of digital whole slide images (WSI) in forensic pathology still needs to be improved. WSI validation is crucial to ensure diagnostic performance, at least equivalent to glass slides and light microscopy. The College of American Pathologists Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center recently updated internal digital pathology system validation recommendations. Following these guidelines, this pilot study aimed to validate the performance of a digital approach for forensic histopathological diagnosis. Six independent skilled forensic pathologists from different forensic medicine institutes evaluated 100 glass slides of forensic interest (80 stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin, 20 with special staining), including different organs and tissues, with light microscopy (Olympus BX51, Tokyo, Japan). Glass slides were scanned using the Aperio GT 450 DX Digital Slides Scanner (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany). After two wash-out weeks, forensic pathologists evaluated WSIs in front of a widescreen using computer devices with dedicated software (O3 viewer, O3 Enterprise, Zucchetti, Trieste, Italy). Side-by-side comparisons between diagnoses performed on tissue glass slides versus WSIs were above the threshold stated in the validation guidelines (mean concordance of 97.8%). CSUQ Version 3 questionnaire showed high satisfaction for all pathologists (mean result: 6.6/7).

For studies requiring accurate segmentation, reviews by multiple independent radiologists remain the gold standard, albeit at a substantial cost. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to semi- or fully-automatic segmentation, but the lack of publicly available, high-quality MR imaging datasets for rectal cancer remains a significant barrier to developing robust AI models. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to foster collaboration between a radiologist and two data scientists in the detection and segmentation of rectal tumors on T2- and diffusion-weighted MR images. By combining the radiologist's clinical expertise with the data scientists' imaging analysis skills, we sought to establish a foundation for future AI-driven approaches that streamline rectal tumor detection and segmentation, and optimize workflow efficiency. METHODS: A total of 37 patients with rectal cancer were included in this study. Through radiologist-led training, attendance at Stanford's weekly Colorectal Cancer Multidisciplinary Tumor Board (CRC MDTB), and the use of radiologist annotations and clinical notes in Epic Electronic Health Records (EHR), data scientists learned how to detect and manually segment tumors on T2- and diffusion-weighted pre-treatment MR images. These segmentations were then reviewed and edited by a radiologist. The accuracy of the segmentations was evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard Index (JI), quantifying the overlap between the segmentations delineated by the data scientists and those edited by the radiologist. RESULTS: With the help of radiologist annotations and radiology notes in Epic EHR, the data scientists successfully identified rectal tumors in Slicer v5.7.0 across all evaluated T2- and diffusion-weighted MR images. Through radiologist-led training and participation at Stanford's weekly CRC MDTB, the data scientists' rectal tumor segmentations exhibited strong agreement with the radiologist's edits, achieving a mean DSC [95% CI] of 0.965 [0.939-0.992] and a mean JI [95% CI] of 0.943 [0.900, 0.985]. Discrepancies in segmentations were attributed to over- or under-segmentation, often incorporating surrounding structures such as the rectal wall and lumen. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of generating high-quality labeled MR datasets through collaboration between a radiologist and two data scientists, which is essential for training AI models to automate tumor detection and segmentation in rectal cancer.

By combining 24/7 data-on location, movement, email and text communications, and social media-with brain scans, genetics, genomics, neuropsychological batteries, and clinical interviews, researchers will have an unprecedented amount of objective, individual-level data. Analyzing these data with ever-evolving artificial intelligence could one day include bringing interventions to patients where they are in the real world in a convenient, efficient, effective, and timely way. Yet, the road to this innovative future is fraught with ethical dilemmas as well as ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Ethics Checklist is to promote careful design and execution of research. It is not meant to mandate particular research designs"," indeed, at this early stage and without consensus guidance, there are a range of reasonable choices researchers may make. However, the checklist is meant to make those ethical choices explicit, and to require researchers to give reasons for their decisions related to ELSI issues. The Ethics Checklist is primarily focused on procedural safeguards, such as consulting with experts outside the research group and documenting standard operating procedures for clearly actionable data (eg, expressed suicidality) within written research protocols. METHODS: We explored the ELSI of digital health research in psychiatry, with a particular focus on what we label """"deep phenotyping"""" psychiatric research, which combines the potential for virtually boundless data collection and increasingly sophisticated techniques to analyze those data. We convened an interdisciplinary expert stakeholder workshop in May 2020, and this checklist emerges out of that dialogue. RESULTS: Consistent with recent ELSI analyses, we find that existing ethical guidance and legal regulations are not sufficient for deep phenotyping research in psychiatry. At present, there are regulatory gaps, inconsistencies across research teams in ethics protocols, and a lack of consensus among institutional review boards on when and how deep phenotyping research should proceed. We thus developed a new instrument, an Ethics Checklist for Digital Health Research in Psychiatry (""""the Ethics Checklist"""").

As rapid improvements in sequencing platforms and new data analysis pipelines are introduced, it is essential to evaluate their capabilities in specific applications. The aim of this study was to assess whether the same project-specific biological conclusions regarding microbiome composition could be reached using different sequencing platforms and bioinformatics pipelines. RESULTS: Chicken cecum microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM, and Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium platforms, with standard and modified protocols for library preparation. We labeled the bioinformatics pipelines included in our analysis QIIME1 and QIIME2 (de novo OTU picking [not to be confused with QIIME version 2 commonly referred to as QIIME2]), QIIME3 and QIIME4 (open reference OTU picking), UPARSE1 and UPARSE2 (each pair differs only in the use of chimera depletion methods), and DADA2 (for Illumina data only). GS FLX yielded the longest reads and highest quality scores, while MiSeq generated the largest number of reads after quality filtering. Declines in quality scores were observed starting at bases 150-199 for GS FLX and bases 90-99 for MiSeq. Scores were stable for PGM-generated data. Overall microbiome compositional profiles were comparable between platforms"," however, average relative abundance of specific taxa varied depending on sequencing platform, library preparation method, and bioinformatics analysis. Specifically, QIIME with de novo OTU picking yielded the highest number of unique species and alpha diversity was reduced with UPARSE and DADA2 compared to QIIME. CONCLUSIONS: The three platforms compared in this study were capable of discriminating samples by treatment, despite differences in diversity and abundance, leading to similar biological conclusions. Our results demonstrate that while there were differences in depth of coverage and phylogenetic diversity, all workflows revealed comparable treatment effects on microbial diversity.

ChP enlargement is seen in normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite its key role of in the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB), detailed studies on age-related changes in its perfusion and microstructure remain limited. METHODS: We analyzed data from 641 healthy individuals aged between 36 and 90, using the Human Connectome Project Aging (HCP-A) dataset. Volumetric, perfusion, and diffusion metrics of the ChP were derived from structural MRI, arterial spin labeling (ASL), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), respectively. Partial correlations were used to explore age-related ChP changes, and independent t-tests to examine sex differences across age decades. One-way ANOVA was employed to compare perfusion characteristics among ChP, gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM). Relationships between volume, perfusion, and diffusion were investigated, adjusting for age and sex. Additionally, the distribution of cyst-like structures within the ChP and their diffusion/perfusion MRI characteristics were analyzed across different age groups. RESULTS: The ChP undergoes notable changes with age, including an increase in volume (r(2) = 0.2, P < 0.001), a decrease in blood flow (r(2) = 0.17, P < 0.001), and elevated mean diffusivity (MD) values (r(2) = 0.16, P < 0.001). Perfusion characteristics showed significant differences between the ChP, GM, and WM (P < 0.001). Both the ChP and GM exhibited age-related declines in CBF, with a more pronounced decline in the ChP. A negative correlation was observed between the age-related increase in ChP volume and the decrease in CBF, suggesting compensatory dystrophic hyperplasia in response to perfusion decline. Cyst-like structures in ChP, characterized by lower MD and reduced CBF, were found to be more prevalent in older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a detailed quantitative assessment of age-related changes in ChP perfusion and diffusion, which may affect CSF production and circulation, potentially leading to waste solute accumulation and cognitive impairment.

However, standard single-SNP GWASs suffer from lack of power. In particular, they do not directly account for linkage disequilibrium, that is the dependences between SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). RESULTS: We present the comparative study of two multilocus GWAS strategies, in the random forest-based framework. The first method, T-Trees, was designed by Botta and collaborators (Botta et al., PLoS ONE 9(4):e93379, 2014). We designed the other method, which is an innovative hybrid method combining T-Trees with the modeling of linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is modeled through a collection of tree-shaped Bayesian networks with latent variables, following our former works (Mourad et al., BMC Bioinformatics 12(1):16, 2011). We compared the two methods, both on simulated and real data. For dominant and additive genetic models, in either of the conditions simulated, the hybrid approach always slightly performs better than T-Trees. We assessed predictive powers through the standard ROC technique on 14 real datasets. For 10 of the 14 datasets analyzed, the already high predicted power observed for T-Trees (0.910-0.946) can still be increased by up to 0.030. We also assessed whether the distributions of SNPs' scores obtained from T-Trees and the hybrid approach differed. Finally, we thoroughly analyzed the intersections of top 100 SNPs output by any two or the three methods amongst T-Trees, the hybrid approach, and the single-SNP method. CONCLUSIONS: The sophistication of T-Trees through finer linkage disequilibrium modeling is shown beneficial. The distributions of SNPs' scores generated by T-Trees and the hybrid approach are shown statistically different, which suggests complementary of the methods. In particular, for 12 of the 14 real datasets, the distribution tail of highest SNPs' scores shows larger values for the hybrid approach. Thus are pinpointed more interesting SNPs than by T-Trees, to be provided as a short list of prioritized SNPs, for a further analysis by biologists. Finally, among the 211 top 100 SNPs jointly detected by the single-SNP method, T-Trees and the hybrid approach over the 14 datasets, we identified 72 and 38 SNPs respectively present in the top25s and top10s for each method."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2054-0,""*Algorithms",Bayes Theorem,"Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics",Computer Simulation,"Databases, Genetic",*Genetic Loci,*Genome-Wide Association Study,Humans,

However, the expression profiles and functions of circRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unknown. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to assess circRNA expression profiles in 4 paired CRC tissues, and significantly dysregulated circRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to predict the potential functions of dysregulated circRNAs. Target miRNAs of circRNAs were predicted using miRanda software, and were further analyzed combining DIANA-miRPath v.3 platform (Reverse Search module) with KEGG pathways of COLORECTAL CANCER and MicroRNAs in cancer (Entry: map05210 and map05206). CircRNA-miRNA interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape software. Expression levels of a significantly down-regulated circRNA, circDDX17 (hsa_circ_0002211), was detected by qRT-PCR in 60 paired CRC tissues. CircDDX17 was knockdown by siRNA, and the biological functions of circDDX17 were examined in CRC cell lines. RESULTS: Totally 448 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, including 394 up-regulated and 54 down-regulated circRNAs. qRT-PCR validation confirmed the reliability of the RNA-Seq data. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these dysregulated circRNAs were potentially implicated in CRC pathogenesis. Analyses by combining miRanda and miRPath softwares with KEGG pathways suggested that the miRNAs targeted by the top 10 dysregulated circRNAs were associated with the KEGG pathways of COLORECTAL CANCER and MicroRNAs in cancer, indicating that circRNA-miRNA interactions might play important functional roles in the initiation and progression of CRC. The results of qRT-PCR for circDDX17 in 60 paired CRC tissues showed that circDDX17 was significantly down-regulated in CRC tissues and associated with unfavorable clinicopathological parameters. In vitro experiments showed that silencing of circDDX17 promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have identified numerous circRNAs that are dysregulated in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal mucosa tissues. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that these dysregulated circRNAs might play important functional roles in CRC tumorigenesis. CircDDX17 functions as a tumor suppressor and could serve as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for CRC."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13046-018-1006-x,""Apoptosis/genetics","Cell Line, Tumor",Cell Movement/genetics,Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology,Computational Biology/methods,DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics,"Genes, Tumor Suppressor",High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods,

Observational studies suggest that digital health interventions can be an effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, evidence from large randomised clinical trials is lacking. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CV-PREVITAL study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label interventional trial designed to compare the effectiveness of an educational and motivational mobile health (mHealth) intervention versus usual care in reducing CV risk. The intervention aims at improving diet, physical activity, sleep quality, psycho-behavioural aspects, as well as promoting smoking cessation and adherence to pharmacological treatment for CV risk factors. The trial aims to enrol approximately 80 000 subjects without overt CVDs referring to general practitioners' offices, community pharmacies or clinics of Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care (Italian acronym IRCCS) affiliated with the Italian Cardiology Network. All participants are evaluated at baseline and after 12 months to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on short-term endpoints, namely improvement in CV risk score and reduction of major CV risk factors. Beyond the funded life of the study, a long-term (7 years) follow-up is also planned to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on the incidence of major adverse CV events. A series of ancillary studies designed to evaluate the effect of the mHealth intervention on additional risk biomarkers are also performed.

The hazard characterisation of all these forms is not only technically challenging but resource and time demanding. The use of non-testing strategies like read-across is deemed essential to assure the assessment of all NMs in due time and at lower cost. The fact that read-across is based on the structural similarity of substances represents an additional difficulty for NMs as in general their structure is not unequivocally defined. In such a scenario, the identification of physicochemical properties affecting the hazard potential of NMs is crucial to define a grouping hypothesis and predict the toxicological hazards of similar NMs. In order to promote the read-across of NMs, ECHA has recently published """"Recommendations for nanomaterials applicable to the guidance on QSARs and Grouping"""", but no practical examples were provided in the document. Due to the lack of publicly available data and the inherent difficulties of reading-across NMs, only a few examples of read-across of NMs can be found in the literature. This manuscript presents the first case study of the practical process of grouping and read-across of NMs following the workflow proposed by ECHA. METHODS: The workflow proposed by ECHA was used and slightly modified to present the read-across case study. The Read-Across Assessment Framework (RAAF) was used to evaluate the uncertainties of a read-across within NMs. Chemoinformatic techniques were used to support the grouping hypothesis and identify key physicochemical properties. RESULTS: A dataset of 6 nanoforms of TiO(2) with more than 100 physicochemical properties each was collected. In vitro comet assay result was selected as the endpoint to read-across due to data availability. A correlation between the presence of coating or large amounts of impurities and negative comet assay results was observed. CONCLUSION: The workflow proposed by ECHA to read-across NMs was applied successfully. Chemoinformatic techniques were shown to provide key evidence for the assessment of the grouping hypothesis and the definition of similar NMs. The RAAF was found to be applicable to NMs."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12989-018-0273-1,""Chemical Safety/*methods","Databases, Factual",*Endpoint Determination,Hazardous Substances/chemistry/*classification/toxicity,Nanostructures/chemistry/*classification/toxicity,Principal Component Analysis,Risk Assessment,Titanium/chemistry/*classification/toxicity,

Therefore, identification of common coexpression network or modules may reveal the molecular mechanism of complex disease or the relationship between biological processes. However, there has been no quantitative network comparison method for coexpression networks and we examined previous methods for other networks that cannot be applied to coexpression network. Therefore, we aimed to propose quantitative comparison methods for coexpression networks and to find common biological mechanisms between Huntington's disease and brain aging by the new method. RESULTS: We proposed two similarity measures for quantitative comparison of coexpression networks. Then, we performed experiments using known coexpression networks. We showed the validity of two measures and evaluated threshold values for similar coexpression network pairs from experiments. Using these similarity measures and thresholds, we quantitatively measured the similarity between disease-specific and aging-related coexpression modules and found similar Huntington's disease-aging coexpression module pairs. CONCLUSIONS: We identified similar Huntington's disease-aging coexpression module pairs and found that these modules are related to brain development, cell death, and immune response.

This study analyzes the psychophysiological effects of four-week workplace resilience training with mobile HRV-BfB and the influence of instruction format (digital or live) on training success. This was a prospective, three-arm, non-randomized controlled trial with parallel group design. 73 employees of a bearing and seal manufacturer (58.9% male, 86.3% full-time employment, 67.1% office workers) attended resilience training with HRV-BfB, live (n = 24) or digital (n = 19) format, or served as waitlist controls (n = 30). HRV-BfB training spanned four weeks. Participants applied resilience techniques to increase HRV using visual biofeedback. Data were collected at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and another four weeks later (T2). Primary outcome measure was the Burnout scale of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) at T1. Secondary outcome measures included further COPSOQ scales, self-reported sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and HRV parameters. Burnout parameters decreased significantly in HRV-BfB and waitlist. The decrease (T0-T1 and T0-T2) showed higher effect sizes in HRV-BfB (Cohen's d: 0.63", 0.69) than in waitlist (d: 0.27, 0.36).

RESULTS: We analyzed 263 responses. Seventy-one percentage of participants were male, with a median age of 49 years (IQR 41-57). Seventy-three percentage of participants carried out a senior role, with a median of 22 years of work experience (IQR 13-28). AI in CDM was seen as helpful for workload management (48%) but not for preventing unnecessary treatments (32%).

Stemness is a pivotal factor in tumor progression, recurrence, and metastasis. Nevertheless, the impact of stemness-related long non-coding RNAs (SRlncRNAs) on the prognosis of ccRCC remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to delve into the SRlncRNAs of ccRCC and develop a signature for risk stratification and prognosis prediction. METHOD: Gene-expression and clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. We calculated RNA stemness scores (RNAss) for the samples to evaluate their stemness. SRlncRNAs and stemness-related mRNAs (SRmRNAs) in ccRCC were identified through weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), which employed sophisticated statistical methodologies to identify interconnected modules of related genes. Enrichment analysis was performed to explore the potential functions of SRmRNAs. Multiple machine learning algorithms were employed to construct a prognostic signature. Samples from TCGA-KIRC and GSE29609 cohorts were designated as the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Based on their risk scores, samples were stratified into low- and high-risk groups. Prognosis analysis, immune infiltration assessment, drug sensitivity prediction, mutation landscape, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted to investigate the distinct characteristics of the low- and high-risk groups. Additionally, a web-based calculator was developed to facilitate clinical application. Expression and effects of SRlncRNAs in ccRCC were further corroborated through the utilization of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), as well as in vitro and in vivo experiments. RESULTS: SRlncRNAs and SRmRNAs were identified based on RNAss and WGCNA. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in combination with multivariate Cox regression was selected as the optimal approach. Six SRlncRNAs were used to construct the prognostic signature. Samples in the low- and high-risk groups exhibited distinct characteristics in terms of prognosis, GSEA pathways, immune infiltration profiles, drug sensitivity, and mutation status. A nomogram and a web-based calculator were developed to facilitate the clinical application of the model. ScRNA-seq and RT-qPCR demonstrated the differential expression of SRlncRNAs between ccRCC tumors and normal tissues. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that downregulation of EMX2OS and LINC00944 affected the proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and metastasis of ccRCC cells. CONCLUSION: We uncovered the crucial associations between SRlncRNAs and the prognosis of ccRCC. By leveraging these findings, we developed a novel SRlncRNA-related signature and a user-friendly web calculator. This signature holds great potential in facilitating risk stratification and guiding tailored treatment strategies for ccRCC patients. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the role of SRlncRNAs in the progression of ccRCC."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12967-025-06251-6,""*RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism

In this study, our working hypothesis was that, with the application of digital image analysis technology, visually unquantifiable breast cancer microarchitectural features can be rigorously assessed and tested as prognostic parameters for invasive breast carcinoma of no special type. METHODS: Digital image analysis was performed using public domain software (ImageJ) on tissue microarrays from a cohort of 696 patients, and validated with a commercial platform (Visiopharm). Quantified features included elements defining tumour microarchitecture, with emphasis on the extent of tumour-stroma interface. The differential prognostic impact of tumour nest microarchitecture in the four immunohistochemical surrogates for molecular classification was analysed. Prognostic parameters included axillary lymph node status, breast cancer-specific survival, and time to distant metastasis. Associations of each feature with prognostic parameters were assessed using logistic regression and Cox proportional models adjusting for age at diagnosis, grade, and tumour size. RESULTS: An arrangement in numerous small nests was associated with axillary lymph node involvement. The association was stronger in luminal tumours (odds ratio (OR) = 1.39, p = 0.003 for a 1-SD increase in nest number, OR = 0.75, p = 0.006 for mean nest area). Nest number was also associated with survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.15, p = 0.027), but total nest perimeter was the parameter most significantly associated with survival in luminal tumours (HR = 1.26, p = 0.005). In the relatively small cohort of triple-negative tumours, mean circularity showed association with time to distant metastasis (HR = 1.71, p = 0.027) and survival (HR = 1.8, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that tumour arrangement in few large nests indicates a decreased metastatic potential. By contrast, organisation in numerous small nests provides the tumour with increased metastatic potential to regional lymph nodes. An outstretched pattern in small nests bestows tumours with a tendency for decreased breast cancer-specific survival. Although further validation studies are required before the argument for routine quantification of microarchitectural features is established, our approach is consistent with the demand for cost-effective methods for triaging breast cancer patients that are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13058-018-0934-x,""Adult",Aged,Breast/diagnostic imaging/*ultrastructure,Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*ultrastructure,Disease-Free Survival,Female,Humans,"Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",

Thus, the aim of this study was to explore patient innovators' reasons for and experiences of authoring scientific publications about their innovations. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 international patient innovators from three continents who had published in scientific journals. Participants were identified through a scoping review on patient-driven innovations and snowball sampling. Interviews were conducted from June to October 2022 and the data was analyzed using the Framework Method. FINDINGS: Participants' reasons for publishing in scientific journals were to strengthen the roles and voices of patients and informal caregivers, and to get recognition for their innovations. Some published as a response to serendipitous opportunities. Several positive experiences were reported: collaborations defined by transparency, mutual respect, and meaningful participation", learning and competence development," and gained confidence regarding the value of lived experiences in research. Participants also reported negative experiences, such as cultural barriers manifested as conservatism in academia and power imbalances between participants and researchers, and structural barriers regarding academic affiliations and research funding.

The purpose of this work is to improve cardiac IVIM parameter mapping using Bayesian inference. METHODS: A second-order motion-compensated diffusion weighted spin-echo sequence with navigator-based slice tracking was implemented to collect cardiac IVIM data in early systole in eight healthy subjects on a clinical 1.5 T CMR system. IVIM data were encoded along six gradient optimized directions with b-values of 0-300 s/mm(2). Subjects were scanned twice in two scan sessions one week apart to assess intra-subject reproducibility. Bayesian shrinkage prior (BSP) inference was implemented to determine IVIM parameters (diffusion D, perfusion fraction F and pseudo-diffusion D*). Results were compared to least-squares (LSQ) parameter estimation. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for a given fitting error were assessed for the two methods using simulated data. Reproducibility analysis of parameter estimation in-vivo using BSP and LSQ was performed. RESULTS: BSP resulted in reduced SNR requirements when compared to LSQ in simulations. In-vivo, BSP analysis yielded IVIM parameter maps with smaller intra-myocardial variability and higher estimation certainty relative to LSQ. Mean IVIM parameter estimates in eight healthy subjects were (LSQ/BSP): 1.63 ± 0.28/1.51 ± 0.14·10(-3) mm(2)/s for D, 13.13 ± 19.81/13.11 ± 5.95% for F and 201.45 ± 313.23/13.11 ± 14.53·10(-3) mm(2)/s for D (*). Parameter variation across all volunteers and measurements was lower with BSP compared to LSQ (coefficient of variation BSP vs. LSQ: 9% vs. 17% for D, 45% vs. 151% for F and 111% vs. 155% for D (*)). In addition, reproducibility of the IVIM parameter estimates was higher with BSP compared to LSQ (Bland-Altman coefficients of repeatability BSP vs. LSQ: 0.21 vs. 0.26·10(-3) mm(2)/s for D, 5.55 vs. 6.91% for F and 15.06 vs. 422.80·10(-3) mm(2)/s for D*). CONCLUSION: Robust free-breathing cardiac IVIM data acquisition in early systole is possible with the proposed method. BSP analysis yields improved IVIM parameter maps relative to conventional LSQ fitting with fewer outliers, improved estimation certainty and higher reproducibility.

Notably, the interplay between miRNAs and changes in transcriptomic patterns is not fully understood. Our study seeks to bridge this knowledge gap, employing computational techniques to explore how miRNAs and transcriptomic alterations jointly regulate the development of prostate cancer. The study involved retrieving miRNA expression data from the GEO database specific to prostate cancer. Identification of DEMs was conducted using the 'limma' package in R. Integration of these DEMs with mRNA interactions was done using the MiRTarBase database. Finally, a network depicting miRNA-mRNA interactions was constructed using Cytoscape software to analyze the regulatory network of prostate cancer. The study pinpointed seven pivotal differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) in prostate cancer: hsa-miR-185-5p, hsa-miR-153-3p, hsa-miR-198, hsa-miR-182-5p, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-372-3p, and hsa-miR-188-5p. These miRNAs influence key genes, including FOXO3, NFAT3, PTEN, RHOA, VEGFA, SMAD7, and CDK2, playing significant roles in both tumor suppression and oncogenesis. The analysis revealed a complex network of miRNA-mRNA interactions, comprising 1849 nodes and 3604 edges. Functional Enrichment Analysis through ClueGO highlighted 74 GO terms associated with these mRNA targets. This analysis uncovered their substantial impact on critical biological processes and molecular functions, such as cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity, mitotic DNA damage checkpoint signalling, stress-activated MAPK cascade, regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway, and positive regulation of cell adhesion. Our analysis of miRNAs and DEGs genes revealed an intriguing mix of established and potentially novel regulators in prostate cancer development. These findings both reinforce our current understanding of prostate cancer's molecular landscape and point to unexplored pathways that could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. By mapping these regulatory relationships, our work contributes to the growing knowledge base needed for developing more targeted and effective treatments."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41598-025-85502-4,""Humans",*MicroRNAs/genetics,Male,*Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology,"*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic",*Gene Regulatory Networks,*Computational Biology/methods,*Transcriptome,

This paper proposes three approaches to realize bottom-up governance of DURC from laboratory operation to institutional decision-making levels. First, a technological approach can predict and monitor the dual-use nature of the research target pathogens and their information. Second, an interactive approach is proposed in which diverse stakeholders proactively discuss and examine dual-use issues through research practice. Third, a personnel approach can identify the right persons involved in DURC. These approaches suggest that, going beyond self-governance by researchers, collaborative and networked governance involving diverse actors should become essential. This mode of governance can also be seen in light of the management of research use. Therefore, program design by funding agencies and publication screening by journal publishers continuously contribute to governance at the meso-level. Bottom-up governance may be realized by using an appropriately integrated design of these three approaches at the micro-level, such as dual-use prediction and monitoring, stakeholder dialogue, and background checks. Given that the term 'open science' has been promoted to the research community as part of top-down governance, paying due attention on site to research subjects, research practices, and persons involved in research will provide an opportunity to develop a more socially conscious open science."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1080/20477724.2023.2265626,Humans","*Biomedical Research/organization & administration,37791645,PMC11234915",,,,,,,

Population-based estimates of bone metastasis incidence are limited, often based on autopsy data, and may not reflect current treatment patterns. METHODS: Electronic medical records (OSCER, Oncology Services Comprehensive Electronic Records, 569,000 patients, 52 US cancer centers) were used to identify patients =18 years with a solid tumor diagnosis recorded between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2013, excluding patients with hematologic tumors or multiple primaries. Each patient's index date was set to the date of his or her first solid tumor diagnosis in the selection period. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to quantify the cumulative incidence of bone metastasis with follow-up for each patient from the index date to the earliest of the following events: last clinic visit in the OSCER database, occurrence of a new primary tumor or bone metastasis, end of study (12/31/2014). Incidence estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) are provided for up to 10 years of follow-up for all tumor types combined and stratified by tumor type and stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 382,733 study patients (mean age 64 years"," mean follow-up 940 days), breast (36%), lung (16), and colorectal (12%) tumors were most common. Mean time to bone metastasis was 400 days (1.1 years). Cumulative incidence of bone metastasis was 2.9% (2.9-3.0) at 30 days, 4.8% (4.7-4.8) at one year, 5.6% (5.5-5.6) at two years, 6.9% (6.8-7.0) at five years, and 8.4% (8.3-8.5) at ten years.

Little is known about the actual bottlenecks to health data sharing in Switzerland. AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to assess the obstacles to Swiss health data sharing, including legal, ethical and logistical bottlenecks. METHODS: We identified 37 key stakeholders in data sharing via the Swiss Personalised Health Network ecosystem, defined as being an expert on sharing sensitive health data for research purposes at a Swiss university hospital (or a Swiss disease cohort) or being a stakeholder in data sharing at a public or private institution that uses such data. We conducted semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed, translated when necessary, and de-identified. The entire research team discussed the transcripts and notes taken during each interview before an inductive coding process occurred. RESULTS: Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted (primarily in English) with 17 individuals representing lawyers, data protection officers, ethics committee members, scientists, project managers, bioinformaticians, clinical trials unit members, and biobank stakeholders. Most respondents felt that it was not the actual data transfer that was the bottleneck but rather the processes and systems around it, which were considered time-intensive and confusing. The templates developed by the Swiss Personalised Health Network and the Swiss General Consent process were generally felt to have streamlined processes significantly. However, these logistics and data quality issues remain practical bottlenecks in Swiss health data sharing. Areas of legal uncertainty include privacy laws when sharing data internationally, questions of """"who owns the data"""", inconsistencies created because the Swiss general consent is perceived as being implemented differently across different institutions, and definitions and operationalisation of anonymisation and pseudo-anonymisation. Many participants desired to create a """"culture of data sharing"""" and to recognise that data sharing is a process with many steps, not an event, that requires sustainability efforts and personnel. Some participants also stressed a desire to move away from data sharing and the current privacy focus towards processes that facilitate data access. CONCLUSIONS: Facilitating a data access culture in Switzerland may require legal clarifications, further education about the process and resources to support data sharing, and further investment in sustainable infrastructureby funders and institutions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.57187/s.3538,Humans",Information Dissemination,*Privacy,Qualitative Research,"Switzerland,38579329,",,,,

We then develop a process-oriented ethical map to identify the major ethical risks in each of the different data processing phases. METHODS: We resorted to the literature on eHealth, personalized medicine, precision medicine, and information engineering to identify potential issues and developed a process-oriented ethical map to structure the inquiry in a more systematic way. The ethical map allows us to see how each of the major ethical concerns emerges during the process of transforming raw data into valuable information. Developers of a digital twin for personalized health care service may use this map to identify ethical risks during the development stage in a more systematic way and can proactively address them. RESULTS: This paper provides a working definition of digital twins for personalized health care services by identifying 3 features that distinguish the new application from other eHealth services. On the basis of the working definition, this paper further layouts 10 major operational problems and the corresponding ethical risks. CONCLUSIONS: It is challenging to address all the major ethical risks that a digital twin for a personalized health care service might encounter proactively without a conceptual map at hand. The process-oriented ethical map we propose here can assist the developers of digital twins for personalized health care services in analyzing ethical risks in a more systematic manner."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Janaina""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/33081,*Artificial Intelligence",Delivery of Health Care,Health Services,Humans,Precision Medicine,"*Telemedicine,35099399,PMC8844982",,,"United Kingdom"",31029148,PMC6486995"

The extraordinary circumstances, characterized by elevated stress levels, prolonged working hours, new medical procedures, media attention, and high population expectations, have created an extremely stressful situation for healthcare professionals. This period has offered a unique opportunity to examine the medical system and the responses of healthcare practitioners to stress. This research aimed to identify the work-related factors that significantly impact the mental health of healthcare professionals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three mental health variables were assessed: anxiety, depression and stress. The work-related factors considered were professional degree, type of medical unit (COVID or non-COVID), the number of hours spent at work in a single shift, type of shifts, monthly on-call frequency, and number of COVID-19 treated patients per month. In the spring of 2022, three inventories and a demographic survey were distributed and completed online by 300 healthcare professionals from Timisoara's public hospitals in Romania. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 47.7% reported mild symptoms of anxiety, 65.3% reported moderate levels of stress, and 33% of the participants reported mild symptoms of depression. The intensity of anxious, depressive, and stress symptoms varied significantly depending on the professional degree, number of on-calls per month, the type of medical unit where the participants worked, and the number of SARS CoV-2 patients treated in the previous month. CONCLUSION: Current data underlines the urgency of implementing effective strategies to reduce the stress and anxiety of medical practitioners who work with COVID-19 patients. Possible interventions encompass a variety of approaches, such as improving working conditions, reducing working hours where possible, increasing access to mental health services, and promoting team-building activities to enhance social support among colleagues. Digital mental health interventions, including online counseling and stress management programs, have also shown promise in these challenging times. Sustaining the mental health of medical practitioners is vital to support the continued provision of first-rate care to patients and to build a resilient healthcare workforce capable of navigating future health crises."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2147/JMDH.S424563,"""",37609050,PMC10441651",,,,,,,,

In many cases, organizations have intended for remote engagement to benefit groups that have been marginalized in the sciences. But are they? It is important to consider how remote access affects social justice in conservation biology-i.e., the principle that all people should be equally respected and valued in conservation organizations, programs, projects, and practices. To support such consideration, we describe a typology of justice-oriented principles that can be used to examine social justice in a range of conservation activities. We apply this typology to three conservation areas: (1) remote access to US national park educational programs and data", (2) digitization of natural history specimens and their use in conservation research," and (3) remote engagement in conservation-oriented citizen science. We then address the questions: Which justice-oriented principles are salient in which conservation contexts or activities? How can those principles be best realized in those contexts or activities? In each of the three areas we examined, remote access increased participation, but access and benefits were not equally distributed and unanticipated consequences have not been adequately addressed. We identify steps that can and are being taken to advance social justice in conservation, such as assessing programs to determine if they are achieving their stated social justice-oriented aims and revising initiatives as needed. The framework that we present could be used to assess the social justice dimensions of many conservation programs, institutions, practices, and policies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109788,"""",36408461,PMC9643013",,,,,,

DESIGN: A qualitative study employing semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed by systematic text condensation. SETTING: Conducted in various general practice settings within an urban region in southwestern Norway. SUBJECTS: Eleven GPs were interviewed, chosen to reflect a diverse mix of ages, genders, and professional experiences. RESULTS: The findings reveal that care occupied a central and multifaceted role in GPs daily practice, and that the care aspect of their practice was experienced as a source of personal fulfilment. Technologies such as Secure Digital Messaging (SDM) and Electronic Health Records could enhance the efficiency of care delivery and facilitate better management of patient interactions, however these technologies also present challenges in maintaining the depth of personal engagement that is central to the care ethics that characterise their caring role. The GPs emphasized the necessity of integrating digital tools in a way that supports the relational and ethical foundations of their caregiving role.

This led to the increased global efforts to implement personalized medicine (PM) and pharmacogenomics (PG) in clinical practice. Here we investigated the perceptions of students from different universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) towards PG/PM as well as related ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). This descriptive, cross-sectional study is based on the survey of 559 students from the Faculties of Medicine, Pharmacy, Health Studies, Genetics, and Bioengineering and other study programs. RESULTS: Our results showed that 50% of students heard about personal genome testing companies and 69% consider having a genetic test done. A majority of students (57%) agreed that PM represents a promising healthcare model, and 40% of students agreed that their study program is well designed for understanding PG/PM. This latter opinion seems to be particularly influenced by the field of study (7.23, CI 1.99-26.2, p = 0.003). Students with this opinion are also more willing to continue their postgraduate education in the PM (OR = 4.68, CI 2.59-8.47, p < 0.001).

Unfortunately, the current lack of reliable markers that specifically reflect the level of senescence in cancer greatly hinders our in-depth understanding of this important biological foundation. Therefore, the search for more specific and reliable markers to reveal the specific role of senescent cells in cancer progression is particularly urgent and important. To uncover the role of senescence in gliomas, we collected senescence-related genes for integrated analysis. Consensus clustering was used to subtype gliomas based on the senescence gene set, and we identified two robust prognostic clusters of gliomas with distinct survival outcomes, multi-omics landscapes, immune characteristics, and differential drug responses. Multiple external datasets were used to validate the stability of our subtypes. Various computational and experimental methods, including WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis), ssGSEA (single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis), and machine learning algorithms (lasso regression, support vector machines, random forests), were employed for analysis.

To address this, a time walk correction (TWC) can be done by using the rise time measured with a second threshold. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can also enhance CTR by training with digitized waveforms. It remains to be explored how timing estimation methods utilizing one (LED), two (TWC), or multiple (CNN) waveform data points compare in CTR performance of BGO scintillators. RESULTS: In this work, we compare classical experimental timing estimation methods (LED, TWC) with a CNN-based method using the signals from BGO crystals read out by NUV-HD-MT SiPMs and high-frequency electronics. For 2 × 2 × 3 mm3 crystals, implementing TWC results in a CTR of 129 ± 2 ps FWHM, while employing the CNN yields 115 ± 2 ps FWHM, marking improvements of 18 % and 26 %, respectively, relative to the standard LED estimator. For 2 × 2 × 20 mm3 crystals, both methods yield similar CTR (around 240 ps FWHM), offering a  ~  15 % gain over LED. The CNN, however, exhibits better tail suppression in the coincidence time distribution. CONCLUSIONS: The higher complexity of waveform digitization needed for CNNs could potentially be mitigated by adopting a simpler two-threshold approach, which appears to currently capture most of the essential information for improving CTR in longer BGO crystals. Other innovative deep learning models and training strategies may nonetheless contribute further in a near future to harnessing increasingly discernible timing features in TOF-PET detector signals."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40658-024-00711-6,"""",39821728,PMC11739447",,,,,,,,

Molecular tumour boards feature multidisciplinary teams of clinical experts who meet to discuss complex individual cancer cases. Preparing the meetings is a manual and time-consuming process. PURPOSE: To design a clinical decision support system to improve the multimodal data interpretation in molecular tumour board meetings for lymphoma patients at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. We investigated user needs and system requirements, explored the employment of artificial intelligence, and evaluated the proposed design with primary stakeholders. METHODS: Design science methodology was used to form and evaluate the proposed artefact. Requirements elicitation was done through a scoping review followed by five semi-structured interviews. We used UML Use Case diagrams to model user interaction and UML Activity diagrams to inform the proposed flow of control in the system. Additionally, we modelled the current and future workflow for MTB meetings and its proposed machine learning pipeline. Interactive sessions with end-users validated the initial requirements based on a fictive patient scenario which helped further refine the system. RESULTS: The analysis showed that an interactive secure Web-based information system supporting the preparation of the meeting, multidisciplinary discussions, and clinical decision-making could address the identified requirements. Integrating artificial intelligence via continual learning and multimodal data fusion were identified as crucial elements that could provide accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations. IMPACT: Our work is of methodological importance in that using artificial intelligence for molecular tumour boards is novel. We provide a consolidated proof-of-concept system that could support the end-to-end clinical decision-making process and positively and immediately impact patients. CONCLUSION: Augmenting a digital decision support system for molecular tumour boards with retrospective patient material is promising.

The aims of this research were to compare different methods for conducting and analysing economic evaluations on partial factorial trials and assess the implications of considering factors simultaneously rather than drawing independent conclusions about each comparison. METHODS: We estimated total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) within 10 years of surgery for 2252 patients in the Knee Arthroplasty Trial who were randomised to one or more comparisons of different surgical types. We compared three analytical methods: an """"at-the-margins"""" analysis including all patients randomised to each comparison (assuming no interaction)"," an """"inside-the-table"""" analysis that included interactions but focused on those patients randomised to two comparisons"," and a Bayesian vetted bootstrap, which used results from patients randomised to one comparison as priors when estimating outcomes for patients randomised to two comparisons. Outcomes comprised incremental costs, QALYs and net benefits. RESULTS: Qualitative interactions were observed for costs, QALYs and net benefits. Bayesian bootstrapping generally produced smaller standard errors than inside-the-table analysis and gave conclusions that were consistent with at-the-margins analysis, while allowing for these interactions. By contrast, inside-the-table gave different conclusions about which intervention had the highest net benefits compared with other analyses. CONCLUSIONS: All analyses of partial factorial trials should explore interactions and assess whether results are sensitive to assumptions about interactions, either as a primary analysis or as a sensitivity analysis. For partial factorial trials closely mirroring routine clinical practice, at-the-margins analysis may provide a reasonable estimate of average costs and benefits for the whole trial population, even in the presence of interactions. However, such conclusions will be misleading if there are large interactions or if the proportion of patients allocated to different treatments differs markedly from what occurs in clinical practice. The Bayesian bootstrap provides an alternative to at-the-margins analysis for analysing clinical or economic endpoints from partial factorial trials, which allows for interactions while making use of the whole sample. The same techniques could be applied to analyses of clinical endpoints. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN45837371 .

Long-term outcomes for people with diabetes previously hospitalised with COVID-19 are, however, unknown. This study aimed to determine the longer-term physical and mental health effects of COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes. METHODS: The PHOSP-COVID study is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults discharged from hospital between 1 February 2020 and 31 March 2021 in the UK following COVID-19, involving detailed assessment at 5 and 12 months after discharge. The association between diabetes status and outcomes were explored using multivariable linear and logistic regressions. FINDINGS: People with diabetes who survived hospital admission with COVID-19 display worse physical outcomes compared to those without diabetes at 5- and 12-month follow-up. People with diabetes displayed higher fatigue (only at 5 months), frailty, lower physical performance, and health-related quality of life and poorer cognitive function. Differences in outcomes between diabetes status groups were largely consistent from 5 to 12-months. In regression models, differences at 5 and 12 months were attenuated after adjustment for BMI and presence of other long-term conditions. INTERPRETATION: People with diabetes reported worse physical outcomes up to 12 months after hospital discharge with COVID-19 compared to those without diabetes. These data support the need to reduce inequalities in long-term physical and mental health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with diabetes.

Given the high treatment gap for mental health care, in particular SUD, these individuals risk poorer treatment outcomes in psychiatry. Integrated treatment for psychiatric and SUD disorders has been proposed to reduce the treatment gap for SUD, but access to integrated treatment is low. Digital interventions addressing SUD in psychiatry could potentially make treatment available to patients who otherwise would not have access. In this study """"digital interventions"""" comprise an umbrella term covering all kinds of interventions from minimal motivational app-based interventions to internet-based interventions with and without human guidance, up to remote sessions in telepsychiatry. This study aims to explore healthcare staff perceptions of referring patients to digital interventions for reducing problematic substance use, whether or not diagnosed as SUD, in the psychiatric outpatient setting. METHOD: The study was exploratory with a qualitative design. Data were collected in the Swedish outpatient psychiatry setting, via individual semi-structured interviews with managers, and focus groups with healthcare staff. An adapted form of phenomenological hermeneutical analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the analysis. The first theme was Encountering obstacles on the path to future implementation of digital interventions, with sub-themes: Lacking resources and Feeling concerned about technical solutions. The second theme was Searching for ways forward to achieve increased access to care, with sub-themes: Blended care could facilitate integrated care and Addressing variations in patients' technical skills. The third theme was Taking steps towards the future, with sub-themes: Wanting to know more about digital interventions and Formulating a vision for the future. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a concern that implementing digital interventions in psychiatry will create additional work or be technically challenging. The staff see significant advantages from the patient perspective, but they feel that they themselves need training in implementing digital interventions. In order to establish constructive implementation of digital interventions for SUD in psychiatry, staff attitudes and concerns need to be considered and addressed.

Compared with native-born women, migrant women have an increased prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Miscommunication and language barriers are among the reasons for these results. Thus, language barriers can also lead to providing less information to migrant women. A digital Swedish-Arabic dialog support tool was developed and tested at antenatal care, to facilitate communication between midwives and Arabic-speaking women. This study aimed to describe midwives' perceptions of communication via Swedish-Arabic dialog support (Sadima) in antenatal care. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with 14 midwives in antenatal care with experience communicating using a Swedish-Arabic dialog support tool. The data were collected via semi structured individual interviews and were analyzed via phenomenographic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in three categories: (1) Dialog support - the skill of constructing bridges, comprised the main finding that dialog support facilitated communication by providing a multimodal way of communication including intercultural evidence-based content","(2) Dialog support - challengingly implementing adaptive efficiency, represented the implementation of dialog support to be time-consuming and, eventually, time-efficient when midwives gained digital skills"," and (3) Women and their partners - the ability to be empowered, included the main finding of increased women's empowerment and control over their lives by being less dependent on interpreters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings contribute to the understanding of communication via dialog support based on midwives' experiences. This study highlights that communication via dialog support facilitates communication between midwives and Arabic-speaking women and enhances midwives' working conditions. Within our increasingly heterogeneous societies, health care could provide support for communication via digital dialog support that is women-centered and culturally sensitive to avoid misunderstandings and delayed or incorrect treatment of migrant women."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12884-025-07368-8,Humans",Female,*Qualitative Research,*Prenatal Care/methods,Pregnancy,*Midwifery/methods,"Software,39696381,PMC11658432"

Therefore, we employed a summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approach to identify putative causal effects of the AAM-related genes on hepatitis B virus (HBV)-HCC survival via integrating multi-omics data. METHODS: Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate associations between genetic variants of AAM-related genes and overall survival (OS) of HBV-HCC patients (n = 866). Next, we developed a pathway-specific genetic risk score (GRS) comprising variants in the AAM pathway. Subsequently, putative causal SNPs were prioritized using SMR by integrating HBV-HCC OS data with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and DNA methylation QTLs (mQTLs) from the blood, as well a eQTLs of liver tissues. RESULTS: We identified 23 independent variants associated with HBV-HCC OS, and the pathway-specific GRS derived from the identified variants was a significant predictor of HBV-HCC OS. The addition of the GRS significantly improved the predictive performance of the 5-year survival model (AUC increased from 72.04% to 84.67%, P < 0.001). By integrating HBV-HCC OS associated with the eQTLs and mQTLs from the blood, we identified a putative causal variant rs2074038 across HBV-HCC OS, ACCS expression, and DNA methylation. Furthermore, the integration of liver eQTL data revealed that increased expression levels of ACCS by rs2074038 were associated with a worse HBV-HCC OS. Mechanistically, bioinformatics annotation and luciferase reporter assays further demonstrated that rs2074038 contributes to HBV-HCC progression by allele-specific regulation of the ACCS expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified rs2074038 as a novel functional SNP associated with poor HBV-HCC survival, likely mediated genetic regulation of ACCS expression. These findings suggest that ACCS is a potential therapeutic target and highlight the need for further validation in clinical settings."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12885-025-13604-3,""Humans","*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/virology/mortality",*Liver Neoplasms/genetics/virology/mortality,*Quantitative Trait Loci,"*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",*Hepatitis B virus/genetics,*Mendelian Randomization Analysis,Male,

This work evaluates bias and other performance characteristics depending on missingness and unmeasured confounding by means of two case studies and simulations. METHODS: Two case studies were constructed by taking the treatment arms from two randomised controlled trials and an external real-world data source that exhibited substantial missingness. The indications of the randomised controlled trials were multiple myeloma and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Overall survival was taken as the main endpoint. The effects of missing data and unmeasured confounding were assessed for the case studies by reporting estimated external comparator versus randomised controlled trial treatment effects. Based on the two case studies, simulations were performed broadening the settings by varying the underlying hazard ratio, the sample size, the sample size ratio between the experimental arm and the external comparator, the number of missing covariates and the percentage of missingness. Thereby, bias and other performance metrics could be quantified dependent on these factors. RESULTS: For the multiple myeloma external comparator study, results were in line with the randomised controlled trial, despite missingness and potential unmeasured confounding, while for the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer case study missing data led to a low sample size, leading overall to inconclusive results. Furthermore, for the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer study, missing data in important eligibility criteria led to further limitations. Simulations were successfully applied to gain a quantitative understanding of the effects of missing data and unmeasured confounding. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study confirmed external comparator strengths and limitations by quantifying the impact of missing data and unmeasured confounding using case studies and simulations. In particular, missing data in key eligibility criteria were seen to limit the ability to derive the external comparator target analysis population accurately, while simulations demonstrated the magnitude of bias to expect for various settings."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s40264-024-01467-9,""Humans",Male,*Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy,*Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/mortality,*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,*Computer Simulation,*Bias,"Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic",

Recurrent somatic H3F3A mutations have been described in 92% of GCT cases. GCTs involving the Clivus are extremely rare lesions and less than 15 cases are described in the literature. They represent a surgery challenge and are easily misdiagnosed. Our aim was to reveal if the genetic bases underlying Clival GCTs were the same of GCTs of long bones to improve the diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: The targeted somatic sequencing of GCT-related genes (H3F3A, H3F3B, IDH1, IDH2 and ZNF687) was performed on Clival GCT biopsies of two different cases. Histological analyses on the same tissues were used to detect the neoplastic population and its expression profile. RESULTS: Sanger sequencing revealed that both patients were positive for the p.Gly34Trp mutation in the H3F3A gene. Immunofluorescence assay using monoclonal antibody, specifically detecting the mutant H3.3, highlighted that the mutation only involved the mononuclear cell population and not the multinucleated giant cells. Moreover, immunohistochemistry assay showed that RANKL was highly expressed by the stromal cells within Clival GCT, mimicking what happens in GCT of the long bones. In addition, systematic literature review allowed us to generate a histology-based diagnostic algorithm of the most common clival lesions. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the Clival GCT is genetically defined by somatic mutation in the H3F3A gene, linking it to the GCT of long bones. The similarity with GCTs of long bones let us to hypothesize the utility of Denosumab therapy (already effective for GCTs) in these surgically challenging cases. Moreover, H3F3A genetic screening can be combined to the histological analysis to differentiate GCTs from morphologically similar giant cell-rich sarcomas, while the histological diagnostic algorithm could help the differential diagnosis of other clival lesions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12885-018-4291-z,""Algorithms","*Biomarkers, Tumor",Biopsy,"Cranial Fossa, Posterior/metabolism/*pathology",DNA Mutational Analysis,"Diagnosis, Differential",Female,Giant Cell Tumor of Bone/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism,

Collecting an adequate medical history is challenging but essential in order to use recommended risk scores such as the HEART score (based on history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors, and troponin). Self-reported computerized history taking (CHT) is a novel method to collect structured medical history data directly from the patient through a digital device. CHT is rarely used in clinical practice, and there is a lack of evidence for utility in an acute setting. OBJECTIVE: This substudy of the Clinical Expert Operating System Chest Pain Danderyd Study (CLEOS-CPDS) aimed to evaluate whether patients with acute chest pain can interact effectively with CHT in the ED. METHODS: Prospective cohort study on self-reported medical histories collected from acute chest pain patients using a CHT program on a tablet. Clinically stable patients aged 18 years and older with a chief complaint of chest pain, fluency in Swedish, and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram or serum markers for acute coronary syndrome were eligible for inclusion. Patients unable to carry out an interview with CHT (eg, inadequate eyesight, confusion or agitation) were excluded. Effectiveness was assessed as the proportion of patients completing the interview and the time required in order to collect a medical history sufficient for cardiovascular risk stratification according to HEART score. RESULTS: During 2017-2018, 500 participants were consecutively enrolled. The age and sex distribution (mean 54.3, SD 17.0 years"," 213/500, 42.6% women) was similar to that of the general chest pain population (mean 57.5, SD 19.2 years"," 49.6% women). Common reasons for noninclusion were language issues (182/1000, 18.2%), fatigue (158/1000, 15.8%), and inability to use a tablet (152/1000, 15.2%). Sufficient data to calculate HEART score were collected in 70.4% (352/500) of the patients. Key modules for chief complaint, cardiovascular history, and respiratory history were completed by 408 (81.6%), 339 (67.8%), and 291 (58.2%) of the 500 participants, respectively, while 148 (29.6%) completed the entire interview (in all 14 modules). Factors associated with completeness were age 18-69 years (all key modules: Ps<.001), male sex (cardiovascular: P=.04), active workers (all key modules: Ps<.005), not arriving by ambulance (chief complaint: P=.03"," cardiovascular: P=.045), and ongoing chest pain (complete interview: P=.002). The median time to collect HEART score data was 23 (IQR 18-31) minutes and to complete an interview was 64 (IQR 53-77) minutes. The main reasons for discontinuing the interview prior to completion (n=352) were discharge from the ED (101, 28.7%) and tiredness (95, 27.0%). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients with acute chest pain can interact effectively with CHT on a tablet in the ED to provide sufficient data for risk stratification with a well-established risk score. The utility was somewhat lower in patients 70 years and older, in patients arriving by ambulance, and in patients without ongoing chest pain. Further studies are warranted to assess whether CHT can contribute to improved management and prognosis in this large patient group.

Analyzing and learning from the medication event reports is an important way to prevent the recurrence of these events. Currently, the analysis of medication event reports is ineffective and requires heavy workloads for clinicians. An automated pipeline is proposed to help clinicians deal with the accumulated reports, extract valuable information and generate feedback from the reports. Thus, the strategy of medication event prevention can be further developed based on the lessons learned. METHODS: In order to build the automated pipeline, four classic machine learning classifiers (i.e., support vector machine, Naïve Bayes, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron) were compared to identify the event originating stages, event types, and event causes from the medication event reports. The precision, recall and F-1 measure were calculated to assess the performance of the classifiers. Further, a strategy to measure the similarity of medication event reports in our pipeline was established and evaluated by human subjects through a questionnaire. RESULTS: We developed three classifiers to identify the medication event originating stages, event types and causes, respectively. For the event originating stages, a support vector machine classifier obtains the best performance with an F-1 measure of 0.792. For the event types, a support vector machine classifier exhibits the best performance with an F-1 measure of 0.758. And for the event causes, a random forest classifier reaches an F-1 measure of 0.925.

Given the controversy over proof-of-vaccination credentials-often colloquially called vaccine or immunization """"passports""""-it is imperative to document successes, shortcomings, and recommendations for any future uses. METHODS: This expert consultation applied inductive qualitative content analysis to online video interviews with key informants whose expertise ranged from ethics to public health to computer science to identify what we can learn from this experience with proof-of-vaccination credentials, and what decision-makers must keep in mind for possible future use of such technologies. RESULTS: There remains a lack of consensus regarding appropriate language and scope for digital proof-of-vaccination technologies, the respective roles of the technology sector versus government in design and implementation, and parameters for future use. However, experts agree on many recommendations, including the importance of clear communication, evidence-based rationale for the use of proof-of-vaccination credentials, multidisciplinary consultation including academic experts and the public, and the importance of pan-Canadian standards for accessibility and interoperability. Identified risks of use that emerged, and should be minimized in the future, include risks of coercion and backlash"," threats to access, equity and privacy"," and impacts such as costs of the technology and workload burden of enforcement and fraud detection.

There is concern that the electronic health record is eroding the patient-clinician relationship and distancing clinicians from their patients. New analytic technologies, on the contrary, by taking over repetitive and mundane tasks, can provide an avenue to make medical care more patient-centered by freeing clinicians' time, and the time of the whole clinical care team, to engage with patients. Technology such as advanced speech recognition that optimizes clinicians' workflow could revitalize the patient-clinician relationship and perhaps also improve clinician well-being. Digital phenotyping can gain invaluable additional data from patients using technology that is already used for personal reasons by the majority of patients. The digital transformation of healthcare has the potential to make healthcare more humane and personalized, however, several important steps are needed to avoid the pitfalls that have come with prior iterations of information technology in medicine such as a heightened emphasis on data security and transparency. Both patients and clinicians should be involved from the early stages of development of medical technologies to ensure that they are person-centric. Technologists and engineers developing healthcare technologies should have experiences with the delivery of healthcare and the lives of patients and clinicians.

The purpose of the current study is to generate multidisciplinary reflections and questions around the use of digital consulting and the way it changes the meaning of being a patient and/or a health professional. METHOD: We used a large pre-existing qualitative dataset from the Long-term Conditions Young People Networked Communication (LYNC) study which involved interviews with healthcare professionals and a group of 16-24 years patients with long-term physical and mental health conditions. We conducted a three-stage mixed methods analysis. First, using a small sample of interview data from the LYNC study, we identified three key themes to explore in the data and relevant academic literature. Second, in small groups we conducted secondary analysis of samples of patient and health professional LYNC interview data. Third, we ran a series of rapid evidence reviews. FINDINGS: We identified three key themes: workload/flow, impact of increased access to healthcare and vulnerabilities. Both health professionals and patients were 'on duty' in their role more often. Increased access to healthcare introduced more responsibilities to both patients and health professionals. Traditional concepts in medical ethics, confidentiality, empathy, empowerment/power, efficiency and mutual responsibilities are reframed in the context of digital consulting. CONCLUSIONS: Our collaboration identified conflicts and constraints in the construction of digital patients and digital clinicians. There is evidence that digital technologies change the nature of a medical consultation and with it the identities and the roles of clinicians and patients which, in turn, calls for a redefinition of traditional concepts of medical ethics. Overall, digital consulting has the potential to significantly reduce costs while maintaining or improving patient care and clinical outcomes.

Triggers therefore have an essential role in engaging individuals with digital interventions delivered outside of traditional health care settings, where other events in daily lives and fluctuating motivation to engage in effortful behavior exist. There is an emerging body of literature examining the use of digital triggers for short-term action and longer-term behavior change. However, little attention has been given to understanding the components of digital triggers. Using tailoring as an overarching framework, we separated digital triggers into 5 primary components: (1) who (sender), (2) how (stimulus type, delivery medium, heterogeneity), (3) when (delivered), (4) how much (frequency, intensity), and (5) what (trigger's target, trigger's structure, trigger's narrative). We highlighted key considerations when tailoring each component and the pitfalls of ignoring common mistakes, such as alert fatigue and habituation. As evidenced throughout the paper, there is a broad literature base from which to draw when tailoring triggers to curate behavior change in health interventions. More research is needed, however, to examine differences in efficacy based on component tailoring, to best use triggers to facilitate behavior change over time, and to keep individuals engaged in physical and mental health behavior change efforts.

Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a potential way for active pharmacovigilance on dietary supplements since a fair amount of dietary supplement information, especially those on use status, can be found in clinical notes. Extracting such information is extremely significant for subsequent supplement safety research. METHODS: In this study, we collected 2500 sentences for 25 commonly used dietary supplements and annotated into four classes: Continuing (C), Discontinued (D), Started (S) and Unclassified (U). Both rule-based and machine learning-based classifiers were developed on the same training set and evaluated using the hold-out test set. The performances of the two classifiers were also compared. RESULTS: The rule-based classifier achieved F-measure of 0.90, 0.85, 0.90, and 0.86 in C, D, S, and U status, respectively.

Challenges in finding the clinical capacity to meet this demand can lead to sight-threatening delays in the macular services that provide treatment. Clinical artificial intelligence (AI) technologies pose one opportunity to rebalance demand and capacity in macular services. However, there is a lack of evidence to guide early-adopters seeking to use AI as a solution to demand-capacity imbalance. This study aims to provide guidance for these early adopters on how AI-enabled macular services may best be implemented by exploring what will influence the outcome of AI implementation and why. METHODS: Thirty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants. Data were analysed with the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to identify factors likely to influence implementation outcomes. These factors and the primary data then underwent a secondary analysis using the Fit between Individuals, Technology and Task (FITT) framework to propose an actionable intervention. RESULTS: nAMD treatment should be initiated at face-to-face appointments with clinicians who recommend year-long periods of AI-enabled scheduling of treatments. This aims to maintain or enhance the quality of patient communication, whilst reducing consultation frequency. Appropriately trained photographers should take on the additional roles of inputting retinal imaging into the AI device and overseeing its communication to clinical colleagues, while ophthalmologists assume clinical oversight and consultation roles. Interoperability to facilitate this intervention would best be served by imaging equipment that can send images to the cloud securely for analysis by AI tools. Picture Archiving and Communication Software (PACS) should have the capability to output directly into electronic medical records (EMR) familiar to clinical and administrative staff. CONCLUSION: There are many enablers to implementation and few of the remaining barriers relate directly to the AI technology itself. The proposed intervention requires local tailoring and prospective evaluation but can support early adopters in optimising the chances of success from initial efforts to implement AI-enabled macular services.

An absence of clear direction at systems, organisation and individual levels has created a mobile learning paradox, whereby although nurses understand the benefits of seeking and retrieving discipline or patient-related knowledge and information in real-time, mobile learning is not an explicitly sanctioned nursing activity. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors influencing mobile learning policy development from the perspective of professional nursing organisations. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were undertaken with representatives from professional nursing organisations in December 2016 and January 2017. Recruitment was by email and telephone. Qualitative analysis was conducted to identify the key themes latent in the transcribed data. RESULTS: Risk management, perceived use of mobile technology, connectivity to information and real-time access were key themes that emerged from the analysis, collectively identifying the complexity of innovating within an established paradigm. Despite understanding the benefits and risks associated with using mobile technology at point of care, nursing representatives were reluctant to exert agency and challenge traditional work patterns to alter the status quo. CONCLUSIONS: The themes highlighted the complexity of accessing and using mobile technology for informal learning and continuing professional development. Mobile learning cannot occur at point of care until the factors identified are addressed. Additionally, a reluctance by nurses within professional organisations to advance protocols to govern digital professionalism needs to be overcome. For mobile learning to be perceived as a legitimate nursing function requires a more wholistic approach to risk management that includes all stakeholders, at all levels. The goal should be to develop revised protocols that establish a better balance between the costs and benefits of access to information technology in real-time by nurses."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12912-018-0313-z,"""",30459525,PMC6233582",,,,,,,,

Comparisons of agreement were conducted by way of Fisher's exact tests. Interpretation-reporting times were analyzed on the natural logarithmic scale via a linear mixed model and transformed to the geometric mean. Subjective workflow experience was compared with an exact binomial test. Report errors were compared via a paired random permutation test. RESULTS: There was no difference in bone age determination between atlases (p = 0.495). The interpretation-reporting time (p < 0.001) was significantly faster with the digital method. The faculty indicated preference for the digital atlas (p < 0.001). Signed reports had fewer errors with the digital atlas (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bone age study interpretations performed with the digital method were similar to those performed with the Greulich and Pyle atlas. The digital atlas saved time, improved workflow experience, and reduced reporting errors relative to the Greulich and Pyle atlas when integrated into electronic workflow."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00256-017-2616-7,""Adolescent",Age Determination by Skeleton/*methods,Child,"Child, Preschool",Female,Hand/*anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging,Humans,Infant,

However, digital contact tracing systems raise concerns about data security, system effectiveness, and their potential to normalise privacy-invasive surveillance technologies. In the absence of mandates, public uptake depends on the acceptability and perceived legitimacy of using technologies that log interactions between individuals to build public health capacity. We report on six online deliberative workshops convened in New South Wales to consider the appropriateness of using the COVIDSafe app to enhance Australian contact tracing systems. All groups took the position (by majority) that the protections enacted in the app design and supporting legislation were appropriate. This support is contingent on several system attributes including: the voluntariness of the COVIDSafe app", that the system relies on proximity rather than location tracking," and, that data access is restricted to local public health practitioners undertaking contact tracing. Despite sustained scepticism in media coverage, there was an underlying willingness to trust Australian governing institutions such that in principle acceptance of the new contact tracing technology was easy to obtain. However, tensions between the need to prove system effectiveness through operational transparency and requirements for privacy protections could be limiting public uptake. Our study shows that informed citizens are willing to trade their privacy for common goods such as COVID-19 suppression. But low case numbers and cautionary public discourses can make trustworthiness difficult to establish because some will only do so when it can be demonstrated that the benefits justify the costs to individuals."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s10728-021-00441-1,Australia/epidemiology",*COVID-19/epidemiology/prevention & control,Contact Tracing,Humans,*Mobile Applications,"Privacy,34697720,PMC8545621",

It is a national effort designed to take into account genetic, environmental, and lifestyle differences in the development of individually tailored forms of treatment and prevention. This goal was implemented in March 2015 with the formation of an advisory committee working group to provide a framework for the proposed national research cohort of one million or more participants. The working group further held a public workshop on participant engagement and health equity, focusing on the design of an inclusive cohort, building public trust, and identifying active participant engagement features for the national cohort. Precision techniques offer medical and public health practitioners the opportunity to personally tailor preventive and therapeutic regimens based on informatics applied to large volume genotypic and phenotypic data. The PMI's (All of Us Research Program's) medical and public health promise, its balanced attention to technical and ethical issues, and its nuanced advisory structure made it a natural choice for inclusion in the University of Michigan course """"Issues in Public Health Genetics"""" (HMP 517), offered each fall by the University's School of Public Health. In 2015, the instructors included the PMI as the recurrent case study introduced at the beginning and referred to throughout the course, and as a class exercise allowing students to translate issues into policy. In 2016, an entire class session was devoted to precision medicine and precision public health. In this article, we examine the dialogues that transpired in these three course components, evaluate session impact on student ability to formulate PMI policy, and share our vision for next-generation courses dealing with precision health. Methodology: Class materials (class notes, oral exercise transcripts, class exercise written hand-ins) from the three course components were inspected and analyzed for issues and policy content. The purpose of the analysis was to assess the extent to which course components have enabled our students to formulate policy in the precision public health area. Analysis of student comments responding to questions posed during the initial case study comprised the initial or """"pre-"""" categories. Analysis of student responses to the class exercise assignment, which included the same set of questions, formed the """"post-"""" categories. Categories were validated by cross-comparison among the three authors, and inspected for frequency with which they appeared in student responses. Frequencies steered the selection of illustrative quotations, revealing the extent to which students were able to convert issue areas into actual policies. Lecture content and student comments in the precision health didactic session were inspected for degree to which they reinforced and extended the derived categories. Results: The case study inspection yielded four overarching categories: (1) assurance (access, equity, disparities)"," (2) participation (involvement, representativeness)"," (3) ethics (consent, privacy, benefit sharing)"," and (4) treatment of people (stigmatization, discrimination). Class exercise inspection and analysis yielded three additional categories: (5) financial", (6) educational," and (7) trust-building. The first three categories exceeded the others in terms of number of student mentions (8?14 vs. 4?6 mentions). Three other categories were considered and excluded because of infrequent mention. Students suggested several means of trust-building, including PMI personnel working with community leaders, stakeholder consultation, networking, and use of social media. Student representatives prioritized participant and research institution access to PMI information over commercial access. Multiple schemes were proposed for participant consent and return of results. Both pricing policy and Medicaid coverage were touched on. During the didactic session, students commented on the importance of provider training in precision health. Course evaluation highlighted the need for clarity on the organizations involved in the PMI, and leaving time for student-student interaction. Conclusions: While some student responses during the exercise were terse, an evolution was detectable over the three course components in student ability to suggest tangible policies and steps for implementation. Students also gained surety in presenting policy positions to a peer audience. Students came up with some very creative suggestions, such as use of an electronic platform to assure participant involvement in the disposition of their biological sample and personal health information, and alternate examples of ways to manage large volumes of data. An examination of socio-ethical issues and policies can strengthen student understanding of the directions the Precision Medicine Initiative is taking, and aid in training for the application of more varied precision medicine and public health techniques, such as tier 1 genetic testing and whole genome and exome sequencing. Future course development may reflect additional features of the ongoing All of Us Research Program, and further articulate precision public health approaches applying to populations as opposed to single individuals."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3390/healthcare6030093,"""",30081448,PMC6163426",,,

This study aims to develop an overall composite potential spatial accessibility index to healthcare facilities and services in Sistan and Baluchestan Province in southeast Iran. METHODS: This study employed the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method to create an overall composite spatial accessibility index for healthcare facilities and services in Sistan and Baluchestan Province, southeast Iran. Spatial accessibility for general practitioners, nursing, dentistry, midwifery, pharmacy, medical laboratory, nutrition, public health, radiology, psychology, environmental health, rural health workers, inpatient hospital beds, and five medical specialty services were calculated. Spatial accessibility scores were normalized from 0 to 1 (no access = 0, low = 0.01 to 0.33, moderate = 0.331 to 0.66, high = 0.661 to 1) and aggregated into overall indices of primary, secondary, and overall healthcare accessibility for each district. Inequality was assessed using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient analysis. RESULTS: Low geographic accessibility was found across Sistan and Baluchestan Province, especially in rural areas. Almost 75% of the population had low/no access to overall primary care services within a 30-minute drive time. For secondary care, nearly 45% had low/no access to hospital inpatient beds within a 30-minute drive time, and around 40% had low/no access to specialists within a 60-minute drive time. Just 11.6% of the population had high overall healthcare access. The calculated Gini coefficient of 0.517 for the overall spatial accessibility index to healthcare services in Sistan and Baluchestan Province highlights a highly unequal distribution of healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a useful replicable methodology that combines individual service accessibility metrics into an overall spatial healthcare access index. Furthermore, this study provides evidence of major shortfalls in healthcare access across Sistan and Baluchestan Province. Targeted strategies are required to increase the availability and capacity of services in underserved communities.

Within a learning health care system, a pilot was conducted with an eIC for linking data from electronic health records with national registries, general practitioners, and other hospitals. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the eIC pilot by comparing the response to the eIC with the former traditional paper-based informed consent (IC). We assessed whether the use of eIC resulted in a different study population by comparing the clinical patient characteristics between the response categories of the eIC and former face-to-face IC procedure. METHODS: All patients with increased cardiovascular risk visiting the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands, were eligible for the learning health care system. From November 2021 to August 2022, an eIC was piloted at the cardiology outpatient clinic. Prior to the pilot, a traditional face-to-face paper-based IC approach was used. Responses (ie, consent, no consent, or nonresponse) were assessed and compared between the eIC and face-to-face IC cohorts. Clinical characteristics of consenting and nonresponding patients were compared between and within the eIC and the face-to-face cohorts using multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2254 patients were included in the face-to-face IC cohort and 885 patients in the eIC cohort. Full consent was more often obtained in the eIC than in the face-to-face cohort (415/885, 46.9% vs 876/2254, 38.9%, respectively). Apart from lower mean hemoglobin in the full consent group of the eIC cohort (8.5 vs 8.8"," P=.0021), the characteristics of the full consenting patients did not differ between the eIC and face-to-face IC cohorts. In the eIC cohort, only age differed between the full consent and the nonresponse group (median 60 vs 56"," P=.0002, respectively), whereas in the face-to-face IC cohort, the full consent group seemed healthier (ie, higher hemoglobin, lower glycated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)], lower C-reactive protein levels) than the nonresponse group. CONCLUSIONS: More patients provided full consent using an eIC. In addition, the study population remained broadly similar. The face-to-face IC approach seemed to result in a healthier study population (ie, full consenting patients) than the patients without IC, while in the eIC cohort, the characteristics between consent groups were comparable. Thus, an eIC may lead to a better representation of the target population, increasing the generalizability of results."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/54867,Humans",*Informed Consent/statistics & numerical data,Male,Female,Middle Aged,Aged,

We believe this is a neglected topic and such a complex field of study that we cannot come up with solutions easily or quickly. Therefore, this study is the starting point of a discussion about the ethics of and the need for policies around technologies for workplace health promotion. Method: Based on a literature review, the present study outlines current knowledge of ethical issues in research, development, and implementation of technologies in the workplace. Specifically, the focus is on two ethical issues that play an important role in the worker-employer relation: privacy and autonomy. Application: Two cases indicative for a multidisciplinary project aimed at developing and evaluating sensor and intervention technologies that contribute to keeping ageing workers healthy and effectively employable are explored. A context-specific approach of ethics is used to investigate ethical issues during the development and implementation of sensor and intervention technologies. It is a holistic approach toward the diverse field of participants and stakeholders, and the diversity in perceptions of relevant values, depending on their respective professional languages. Discussion: The results show how protecting the privacy and autonomy of workers cannot be seen as stand-alone issues, but, rather, there is interplay between these values, the work context, and the responsibilities of workers and employers. Consequently, technologies in this research project are designed to improve worker conscientious autonomy, while concurrently creating balance between privacy and health, and assigning responsibilities to appropriate stakeholders. Conclusion: Focusing on a contextual conceptualisation of the ethical principles in the design and implementation of digital health technologies helps to avoid compartmentalization, out-of-context generalisation, and neglect of identifying responsibilities. Although it is a long reiterative process in which all stakeholders need to be included in order to assess all ethical issues sufficiently, this process is crucial to achieving the intended goal of a technology. Having laid out the landscape and problems of ethics around technologies for workplace health promotion, we believe policies and standards, and a very overdue discussion about these, are needed."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Janaina""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fdgth.2021.644539,"""",34713114,PMC8522019",,,,,,,,

Three different versions have been designed in order to derive deeper insights of the user behavior. The test-retest validation of the versions reveals good correlation across sessions. Further, the difference in gaze behavior which might be used as an indicator of cognitive functions is tested for two different age groups (13 participants <30 years and 11 participants >40 years). It is seen that the designed digitized version along with the usage of physiological markers like eye tracking bestows additional information and is sensitive to age related factors which might be used for the assessment as well as for the training purpose in rehabilitation systems.

These medical devices provide exact measures and raw data such as imaging data or biosignals. So far, the Broad Integration of These Health Data into Hospital Information Technology Structures-Especially in Germany-is Lacking, and if data integration takes place, only non-Evaluable Findings are Usually Integrated into the Hospital Information Technology Structures. A Comprehensive Integration of raw Data and Structured Medical Information has not yet Been Established. The aim of this project was to design and implement an interoperable database (cardio-vascular-information-system, CVIS) for the automated integration of al medical device data (parameters and raw data) in cardio-vascular medicine. METHODS: The CVIS serves as a data integration and preparation system at the interface between the various devices and the hospital IT infrastructure. In our project, we were able to establish a database with integration of proprietary device interfaces, which could be integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) with various HL7 and web interfaces. RESULTS: In the period between 1.7.2020 and 30.6.2022, the data integrated into this database were evaluated. During this time, 114,858 patients were automatically included in the database and medical data of 50,295 of them were entered.

Speech, as a sensitive indicator, reveals noticeable acoustic changes linked to physiological and cognitive variations, making it a crucial behavioral marker for detecting depression. However, existing studies often overlook the separation of speaker-related and emotion-related features in speech when recognizing depression. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) method that integrates speaker-related and emotion-related features for depression recognition. Our approach begins with a Time Delay Neural Network to pre-train a speaker-related feature extractor using a large-scale speaker recognition dataset while simultaneously pre-training a speaker's emotion-related feature extractor with a speech emotion dataset. We then apply transfer learning to extract both features from a depression dataset, followed by fusion. A multi-domain adaptation algorithm trains the MoE model for depression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 74.3% accuracy on a self-built Chinese localized depression dataset and an MAE of 6.32 on the AVEC2014 dataset. Thus, it outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods that use speech features.

Emotional symptoms, conduct problems and depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with both weekday and weekend total screen time (weekday r = 0.43, r = 0.31, and r = 0.49, respectively, p < 0.001"," weekend r = 0.47, r = 0.33, and r = 0.54, respectively, p < 0.001). Smartphone usage had the strongest association with depressive symptoms (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). Conclusion This study identifies a significant positive correlation between increased screen time and adverse mental health outcomes in children, particularly emotional symptoms and depressive symptoms. The findings emphasize the need for public health strategies to manage screen time and promote healthier digital habits to mitigate the potential negative effects on children's mental health."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.71215,"""",39525148,PMC11549943",,,,,,,

These advancements contribute to reduced HIV transmission and thereby lead to improved health outcomes. AREAS COVERED: This perspective examines the current landscape of digital HIVST strategies, highlighting challenges that must be addressed and opportunities that are presented as the field evolves. EXPERT OPINION: Implementing advances in digital HIVST requires a unified digital network architecture that integrates proven tools (digital supports) within the World Health Organization's One Health Agenda. This includes strategies effective in diverse settings, supported by evolving governance and ethics frameworks that ensure data safety and privacy. Although data on linkages to care are strong, digital HIVST strategies may need further field validation, especially in low-income countries. Key challenges include systems integration, data privacy safeguards, and implementation of proven digital supports. Embracing digital readers, machine learning solutions, chatbots, and wearable solutions can improve outcomes that translate to significant public health benefits in the context of HIV elimination.

The American Medical Association (AMA) has documented that increased healthcare burden correlates with increased stress, burnout, and psychological burden in HCWs. However, limits on personnel, time, and in person interactions make it challenging to assess mental health outcomes during a pandemic. This pilot study used virtual technology to efficiently assess these outcomes. SETTING: Data were collected based on voluntary participation in the Coping with Covid-19 for Caregivers Survey created by AMA. The survey was sent out to approximately 300 participants who included local physicians, medical residents, medical students, and allied health professionals and students who attended a virtual Mental Health Summit. METHODS: The AMA developed survey included questions about demographics, overall stress, fear of infection and transmission of the virus, perceived anxiety or depression due to Covid-19, work overload, childcare issues, and sense of meaning and purpose. The AMA allows for up to five additional questions to be added to their survey, therefore five questions regarding support service utilization, perseverance, and resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic, and two items to further understand students' areas of medical interest. The survey was administered using an online platform through the AMA. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There were 81 survey respondents. Based on the results of the survey, """"high stress"""" was found in 52 (64%) participants. 66 (81%) were afraid (moderately or to a great extent) of exposure or transmission, 61 (75%) described high levels of anxiety or depression, and 67 (84%) noted work overload. Despite this increase in stress, most respondents (77%) said they were not likely to reduce their devoted hours to clinical care or research in the next 12 months, and 81% answered that they would not leave their practice or research within two years. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 has negatively affected the well-being of HCWs. This is a similar trend seen during other times of healthcare strain. Mental health support, work modulation, and various provisions should be explored as means to reduce Covid-19-related negative impacts. The use of an online summit and online data collection methods were appropriate for collecting data on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health.

Emergency medicine (EM) has been peripheral to the precision medicine discourse, lacking both a unified definition of precision medicine and a clear research agenda. We convened a national consensus conference to build a shared mental model and develop a research agenda for precision EM. METHODS: We held a conference to (1) define precision EM, (2) develop an evidence-based research agenda, and (3) identify educational gaps for current and future EM clinicians. Nine preconference workgroups (biomedical ethics, data science, health professions education, health care delivery and access, informatics, omics, population health, sex and gender, and technology and digital tools), comprising 84 individuals, garnered expert opinion, reviewed relevant literature, engaged with patients, and developed key research questions. During the conference, each workgroup shared how they defined precision EM within their domain, presented relevant conceptual frameworks, and engaged a broad set of stakeholders to refine precision EM research questions using a multistage consensus-building process. RESULTS: A total of 217 individuals participated in this initiative, of whom 115 were conference-day attendees. Consensus-building activities yielded a definition of precision EM and key research questions that comprised a new 10-year precision EM research agenda. The consensus process revealed three themes: (1) preeminence of data, (2) interconnectedness of research questions across domains, and (3) promises and pitfalls of advances in health technology and data science/artificial intelligence. The Health Professions Education Workgroup identified educational gaps in precision EM and discussed a training roadmap for the specialty.

METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis on the cohort of immunocompromised patients enrolled in the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE) study. The LUNG SAFE study was an international, prospective study including hypoxemic patients in 459 ICUs from 50 countries across 5 continents. RESULTS: Of 2813 patients with ARDS, 584 (20.8%) were immunocompromised, 38.9% of whom had an unspecified cause. Pneumonia, nonpulmonary sepsis, and noncardiogenic shock were their most common risk factors for ARDS. Hospital mortality was higher in immunocompromised than in immunocompetent patients (52.4% vs 36.2%"," p < 0.0001), despite similar severity of ARDS. Decisions regarding limiting life-sustaining measures were significantly more frequent in immunocompromised patients (27.1% vs 18.6%", p < 0.0001). Use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as first-line treatment was higher in immunocompromised patients (20.9% vs 15.9%," p = 0.0048), and immunodeficiency remained independently associated with the use of NIV after adjustment for confounders. Forty-eight percent of the patients treated with NIV were intubated, and their mortality was not different from that of the patients invasively ventilated ab initio. CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression is frequent in patients with ARDS, and infections are the main risk factors for ARDS in these immunocompromised patients. Their management differs from that of immunocompetent patients, particularly the greater use of NIV as first-line ventilation strategy. Compared with immunocompetent subjects, they have higher mortality regardless of ARDS severity as well as a higher frequency of limitation of life-sustaining measures.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries, including China, have promoted the introduction of digital health in their medical services. Developing the next generation of physicians with digital health knowledge and skills is a prerequisite for maximizing the potential of digital health. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the perception of digital health among Chinese medical students, the current implementation of digital health education in China, and the urgent need of medical students. METHODS: Our cross-sectional survey was conducted online and anonymously among current medical students in China. We used descriptive statistical analysis to examine participant demographic characteristics and the demand for digital health education. Additional analysis was conducted by grouping responses by current participation in a digital health course. RESULTS: A total of 2122 valid responses were received from 467 medical schools. Most medical students had positive expectations that digital health will change the future of medicine. Compared with wearable devices (85.53%), telemedicine (84.16%), and medical big data (86.38%), fewer respondents believed in the benefits of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) (63.81%). Most respondents said they urgently needed digital health knowledge and skills, and the teaching method of practical training and internship (78.02%) was more popular than the traditional lecture (10.54%). However, only 41.45% wanted to learn about the ethical and legal issues surrounding digital health. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the current needs of Chinese medical students for digital health education remain unmet. A national initiative on digital health education, is necessary and attention should be paid to digital health equity and education globally, focusing on CDSS and artificial intelligence.

A regulatory health authority raised concerns after receiving spontaneous reports for NIU following exposure to Remicade(®), a biologic therapy with multiple indications for which alternative therapies are available. In assessment of this clinical question, we applied validity diagnostics to support observational data causal inferences. METHODS: We assessed the risk of NIU among patients exposed to Remicade(®) compared to alternative biologics. Five databases, four study populations, and four analysis methodologies were used to estimate 80 potential treatment effects, with 20 pre-specified as primary. The study populations included inflammatory bowel conditions Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (IBD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic conditions plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis (PsO/PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conducted four analysis strategies intended to address limitations of causal estimation using observational data and applied four diagnostics with pre-specified quantitative rules to evaluate threats to validity from observed and unobserved confounding. We also qualitatively assessed post-propensity score matching representativeness, and bias susceptibility from outcome misclassification. We fit Cox proportional-hazards models, conditioned on propensity score-matched sets, to estimate the on-treatment risk of NIU among Remicade(®) initiators versus alternatives. Estimates from analyses that passed four validity tests were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 80 total analyses and the 20 analyses pre-specified as primary, 24% and 20% passed diagnostics, respectively. Among patients with IBD, we observed no evidence of increased risk for NIU relative to other similarly indicated biologics (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-1.40). For patients with RA, we observed no increased risk relative to similarly indicated biologics, although results were imprecise (HR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.14-10.47). CONCLUSIONS: We applied validity diagnostics on a heterogenous, observational setting to answer a specific research question. The results indicated that safety effect estimates from many analyses would be inappropriate to interpret as causal, given the data available and methods employed. Validity diagnostics should always be used to determine if the design and analysis are of sufficient quality to support causal inferences.

It is a chronic progressive disease characterized by high-protein edema of various parts of the body due to defects in lymphatic drainage. Molecular-genetic mechanisms of the disease are still poorly understood. Beginning of a clinical manifestation of primary lymphedema in middle age and the development of secondary lymphedema after treatment of breast cancer can be genetically determined. Disruption of endothelial cell apoptosis can be considered as one of the factors contributing to the development of lymphedema. However, a study of the relationship between genes associated with lymphedema and genes involved in endothelial apoptosis, in the associative gene network was not previously conducted. METHODS: In the current work, we used well-known methods (ToppGene and Endeavour), as well as methods previously developed by us, to prioritize genes involved in endothelial apoptosis and to find potential participants of molecular-genetic mechanisms of lymphedema among them. Original methods of prioritization took into account the overrepresented Gene Ontology biological processes, the centrality of vertices in the associative gene network, describing the interactions of endothelial apoptosis genes with genes associated with lymphedema, and the association of the analyzed genes with diseases that are comorbid to lymphedema. RESULTS: An assessment of the quality of prioritization was performed using criteria, which involved an analysis of the enrichment of the top-most priority genes by genes, which are known to have simultaneous interactions with lymphedema and endothelial cell apoptosis, as well as by genes differentially expressed in murine model of lymphedema. In particular, among genes involved in endothelial apoptosis, KDR, TNF, TEK, BMPR2, SERPINE1, IL10, CD40LG, CCL2, FASLG and ABL1 had the highest priority. The identified priority genes can be considered as candidates for genotyping in the studies involving the search for associations with lymphedema. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of interactions of these genes in the associative gene network of lymphedema can improve understanding of mechanisms of interaction between endothelial apoptosis and lymphangiogenesis, and shed light on the role of disturbance of these processes in the development of edema, chronic inflammation and connective tissue transformation during the progression of the disease."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12920-019-0492-9,""Animals",*Apoptosis,"Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type II/genetics",Chemokine CCL2/genetics,"Databases, Genetic","Disease Models, Animal",Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism,*Gene Regulatory Networks,

Existing problems with incomplete PROM data may relate to the patient burden and data set length. This study aimed to analyse response patterns and degree of data completeness in systematic outcome assessments conducted within a clinical study in a multidisciplinary rehabilitation setting, comparing completeness of a brief and a longer set of PROMs. METHODS: The Norwegian RehabNytte Cohort was developed to monitor patients' long-term benefit of rehabilitation and progress on PROMs. Adults admitted to one of 17 institutions providing mostly inpatient rehabilitation in secondary healthcare were included between January 2019 and March 2020, and followed for one year. For the purpose of the current randomized controlled trial, the Cohort-patients in 16/17 institutions were randomized to complete either a brief or a longer set of PROMs at admission, discharge, and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The brief set comprised the EQ-5D-5L and additional generic PROMs commonly used in rehabilitation settings. The longer data set expanded upon the brief set by including the Patient-Specific Functional Scale and the 29-item version of the PROMIS Profile instruments. Completeness was measured as the extent of present applicable PROM data at each time point. In addition, we assessed response patterns in terms of dropout rates and intermittently missed assessment events. The RehabNytte study is registered under ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT03764982, first posted 05.12.2018). RESULTS: Of the 2904 patients included, 1455 were assigned to the brief data set and 1449 to the longer data set. The majority of patients were referred to rehabilitation for rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (39.3%) or cancer (26.9%). The data set completeness was significantly higher in the brief set compared to the longer (p < 0.001). From admission to 12 months follow-up, differences in completeness between groups ranged from 6.5 to 12.6 percentage points, consistently favouring the brief set. Completeness was highest at admission, reaching 96.8% (95% CI 0.96-0.98) for the brief set and 84.2% (95% CI 0.82-0.86) for the longer set. The lowest completeness was observed at discharge, with 46.0% (95% CI 0.43-0.49) for the brief set and 39.5% (95% CI 0.37-0.42) for the longer one. Discharge was the only time point without automatic reminders to non-responders from the digital data collection system. Patients responding to the longer data set exhibited the highest dropout rates, while degree of intermittent missing data was comparable between groups. In both groups, only one-third of patients provided complete or partly responses at all five time points.

SmartNet is a remote electronic monitor that provides objective measurements of bednet use over weeks at a time. Assessing local acceptability is important when implementing innovative global health technologies such as SmartNet. This study draws on established models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) to assess acceptability of SmartNet in Ugandan households. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted at weeks one and six following installation of SmartNet in ten households in Western Uganda. Heads-of-households answered open-ended questions addressing the main acceptability domains of the TFA and TAM models (i.e. perceived ease of use, ethicality, etc.). Responses were digitally recorded, transcribed, coded and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Seven out of ten households interviewed reported no difference in use between SmartNet and a standard LLIN. Households stated the large size, soft fabric, and the efficacy of SmartNet relative to a standard LLIN contributed to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Opportunity costs of the novel monitoring system expressed by households included difficulty washing nets and dislike of blinking lights on the device. Barriers to SmartNet use focused on questions of the ethics of bednet use monitoring, discomfort with technical aspects of the device and a poor understanding of its function amongst others in the community. However, explaining SmartNet to other community members resolved these concerns and often resulted in interest and acceptance among peers. CONCLUSION: Objective monitoring of bednet use with SmartNet appears acceptable to these households in Uganda. Use of SmartNet seems to be similar to behaviors around use of standard LLINs. Viewpoints on many aspects of SmartNet were generally favorable. Concerns around ethicality of bednet monitoring are present and indicate the need for continuing community education. The device will continue to be optimized to make it more acceptable to users and to accurately reflect standard LLIN use to improve our understanding of prevention behaviors in malaria endemic settings."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12889-022-13393-5,Cross-Sectional Studies",Electronics,Humans,*Insecticide-Treated Bednets,*Malaria/epidemiology/prevention & control,Mosquito Control,"Uganda,35590303,PMC9118600",,

The rationale behind this approach is that this will bring a number of benefits and enable advances in healthcare and medicine by allowing the maximum returns from the investment in research, as well as reducing waste and promoting transparency. As this approach gains momentum, these data-sharing practices have implications for many kinds of research as they become standard practice across the world. MAIN TEXT: The governance frameworks that have been developed to support biomedical research are not well equipped to deal with the complexities of international data sharing. This system is nationally based and is dependent upon expert committees for oversight and compliance, which has often led to piece-meal decision-making. This system tends to perpetuate inequalities by obscuring the contributions and the important role of different data providers along the data stream, whether they be low- or middle-income country researchers, patients, research participants, groups, or communities. As research and data-sharing activities are largely publicly funded, there is a strong moral argument for including the people who provide the data in decision-making and to develop governance systems for their continued participation. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that governance of science becomes more transparent, representative, and responsive to the voices of many constituencies by conducting public consultations about data-sharing addressing issues of access and use", including all data providers in decision-making about the use and sharing of data along the whole of the data stream," and using digital technologies to encourage accessibility, transparency, and accountability.

After infection, patients experience a natural course from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and even Hepatitis B associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HBV-HCC). With the multi-omics research, many differentially expressed genes from chronic hepatitis to HCC stages have been discovered. All these provide important clues for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The purpose of this study is to explore the differential gene expression of HBV and HBV-related liver cancer, and analyze their enrichments and significance of related pathways. METHODS: In this study, we downloaded four microarray datasets GSE121248, GSE67764, GSE55092, GSE55092 and GSE83148 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Using these four datasets, patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) differentially expressed genes (CHB DEGs) and patients with HBV-related HCC differentially expressed genes (HBV-HCC DEGs) were identified. Then Protein-protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed to excavate the functional interaction of these two groups of DEGs and the common DEGs. Finally, the Kaplan website was used to analyze the role of these genes in HCC prognostic. RESULTS: A total of 241 CHB DEGs, 276 HBV-HCC DEGs, and 4 common DEGs (cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily A member 1 (CYP26A1), family with sequence similarity 110 member C(FAM110C), SET and MYND domain containing 3(SMYD3) and zymogen granule protein 16(ZG16)) were identified. CYP26A1, FAM110C, SMYD3 and ZG16 exist in 4 models and interact with 33 genes in the PPI network of CHB and HBV-HCC DEGs,. GO function analysis showed that: CYP26A1, FAM110C, SMYD3, ZG16, and the 33 genes in their models mainly affect the regulation of synaptic vesicle transport, tangential migration from the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb, cellular response to manganese ion, protein localization to mitochondrion, cellular response to dopamine, negative regulation of neuron death in the biological process of CHB. In the biological process of HBV-HCC, they mainly affect tryptophan catabolic process, ethanol oxidation, drug metabolic process, tryptophan catabolic process to kynurenine, xenobiotic metabolic process, retinoic acid metabolic process, steroid metabolic process, retinoid metabolic process, steroid catabolic process, retinal metabolic process, and rogen metabolic process. The analysis of the 4 common DEGs related to the prognosis of liver cancer showed that: CYP26A1, FAM110C, SMYD3 and ZG16 are closely related to the development of liver cancer and patient survival. Besides, further investigation of the research status of the four genes showed that CYP26A1 and SMYD3 could also affect HBV replication and the prognosis of liver cancer. CONCLUSION: CYP26A1, FAM110C, SMYD3 and ZG16 are unique genes to differentiate HBV infection and HBV-related HCC, and expected to be novel targets for HBV-related HCC occurrence and prognostic judgement."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1097/MD.0000000000026917,""Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/*virology",Computational Biology,Hepatitis B virus/*genetics,"Hepatitis B, Chronic/*complications/drug therapy/*virology",Humans,"Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*virology"",34414947,PMC8376394",,,

The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that this practice is equally vital for augmenting patient research. In addition, data sharing acts as a necessary safeguard against the introduction of analytical biases. While the pandemic provided an opportunity to curtail critical research issues such as reproducibility and validity through data sharing, this did not materialise in practice and became an example of 'Open Data in Appearance Only' (ODIAO). Here, we define ODIAO as the intent of data sharing without the occurrence of actual data sharing (eg, material or digital data transfers).Objective Propose a framework that states the main risks associated with data sharing, systematically present risk mitigation strategies and provide examples through a healthcare lens.Methods This framework was informed by critical aspects of both the Open Data Institute and the NIH's 2023 Data Management and Sharing Policy plan guidelines.Results Through our examination of legal, technical, reputational and commercial categories, we find barriers to data sharing ranging from misinterpretation of General Data Privacy Rule to lack of technical personnel able to execute large data transfers. From this, we deduce that at numerous touchpoints, data sharing is presently too disincentivised to become the norm.Conclusion In order to move towards Open Data, we propose the creation of mechanisms for incentivisation, beginning with recentring data sharing on patient benefits, additional clauses in grant requirements and committees to encourage adherence to data reporting practices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmjhci-2023-100771,Humans",United States,*COVID-19,Pandemics,Reproducibility of Results,National Institutes of Health (U.S.),"Information Dissemination/methods,37344002,PMC10314418",,

EBHPs increase transparency, accountability, effectiveness, and efficiency of policies. Encouraging collaboration between researchers or knowledge producers and policy makers is important because both communities have distinct professional cultures, resulting in them working separately without understanding each other. Knowledge sharing is a complex process that requires understanding of cultural aspects that may reduce cultural differences and increase the use of common language. Health information technology (HIT) is a useful tool to increase knowledge translation, which may result in the transparent use of evidence and networking in developing EBHPs. Our vision is to leverage HIT tools for a better health system that includes digitalized, open source, evidence-based, and transparent ways for collaboration and development of robust mechanisms and for sharing of synthesized evidence with knowledge user-friendly forms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a conceptual framework on Knowledge translation and health Information Technology for Transparency (KhITT) in policy making and EBHPs (ie, the KhITT framework). The framework will be informed by the views of four key stakeholder groups (ie, policy makers, knowledge producers, HIT professionals, and the public) toward EBHP. The informants may also describe practices that demonstrate the EBHP development process and suggest technology platforms to enable this process. METHODS: We propose an exploratory, descriptive qualitative study to take place in British Columbia, Canada, using in-depth semistructured interviews. To ensure data saturation and trustworthiness, we will use a nonprobability, purposive snowball sample of up to 15 eligible participants in each of the four stakeholder groups. We will analyze the data using content analysis. RESULTS: The KhITT framework focuses on various stakeholders' perspectives to better understand their perceived needs and priorities in identifying issues with EBHP, in order to make informed recommendations. Ethics approval has been obtained by the harmonized Behavioural Research Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia. We anticipate that we will complete data collection and analysis by December 2020. Preliminary results will be published in summer 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Our ultimate goal of this study is to develop a conceptual framework and describe the technology platforms that would enable the EBHP process. We anticipate that our rigorous content analysis will be able to produce insights and themes that are able to address our objectives, contribute to an in-depth understanding of the EBHP process within British Columbia, highlight all influential factors, explicitly disseminate and communicate the study results, identify issues with EBHP and provide informed recommendations to address them, and enhance efforts toward transparent EBHPs.

This study aimed to explore the downstream mechanism of METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification in IS. GSE16561 and GSE22255 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database for analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and it was found that METTL3 mRNA was downregulated in IS. Then quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to verify the downregulation of METTL3 mRNA in the peripheral blood of IS patients and the cortexes of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mice. By combining DEGs with the m(6)A-downregulated genes in GSE142386 which performed methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) on METTL3-deficient and control endothelial cells, a total of 131 genes were identified as the METTL3-mediated m(6)A-modified genes in IS. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that the genes were mainly involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. CTSS and SBK1 were further screened as the key METTL3-mediated m(6)A-modified genes by random forest model and PCR validation. The ROC curve analysis showed that the combination with CTSS and SBK1 was of good diagnostic value for IS, with the AUC of 0.810, sensitivity of 0.780, and specificity of 0.773.

The Protego Maxima trial investigated the value of a new digitized risk assessment tool that combines tools which can be easily used and implemented in the clinical workflow by doctors and qualified medical staff. The hypothesis was that the structured assessment and risk-grouping is predictive of short-term surgical quality reflected by complications and overall survival. METHODS: The Protego Maxima Trial was a prospective cohort analysis of patients undergoing major surgery (visceral, thoracic, urology, vascular and gynecologic surgeries) as key inclusion criterion and the absence of an acute or acute on chronically decompensated pulmo-cardiovascular decompensation. Patients were risk-scored with the software (The Prehab App) that includes a battery of evidence-based risk assessment tools that allow a structured risk assessment. The data were grouped to predefined high and low risk groups and aggregate and individual scores. The primary outcome was to validate the predictive value of the RAI score and the TUG for overall survival in the high and low risk groups. Secondary outcomes were surgical outcomes at 90-days after surgery (overall survival, Clavien-Dindo (CD) 1-5 (all complications), and CD 3-5 (major complications)). The study was carried out in accordance with the DIN ISO 14,155, and the medical device regulation (MDR) at Frankfurt University Hospital between March 2022 and January 2023. RESULTS: In total 267 patients were included in the intention to treat analysis. The mean age was 62.1 ± 12.4 years. Patients with a RAI score > 25 and/or a timed up and go (TUG) > 8 s had a higher risk for mortality at 90 days after surgery. The low-risk group predicted beneficial outcome and the high-risk group predicted adverse outcome in the ROC analysis (Area Under the Curve Receiver Operator Characteristics: AUROC > 0.800", p = 0.01). Risk groups (high vs. low) showed significant differences for 90-day survival (99.4% vs. 95.5%, p = 0.04) and major complications (16.4% vs. 32.4%," p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The proof-of-concept trial showed that a risk assessment with 'The Prehab App' may be viable to estimate the preoperative risk for mortality and major complications before major surgeries. The overall performance in this initial set of data indicated a certain reliability of the scoring and risk grouping, especially of the RAI score and the TUG. A larger data set will be required to proof the generalizability of the risk scoring to every subgroup and may be fostered by artificial intelligence approaches.

Maintaining consistently high data return rates has various benefits for trials, including enhancing oversight, improving reliability of central monitoring techniques and helping prepare for database lock and trial analyses. Despite this, there is little evidence to support best practice, and current standard methods may not be optimal. METHODS: We report novel methods from the Trial of Imaging and Schedule in Seminoma Testis (TRISST), a UK-based, multi-centre, phase III trial using paper Case Report Forms to collect data over a 6-year follow-up period for 669 patients. Using an automated database report which summarises the data return rate overall and per centre, we developed a Microsoft Excel-based tool to allow observation of per-centre trends in data return rate over time. The tool allowed us to distinguish between forms that can and cannot be completed retrospectively, to inform understanding of issues at individual centres. We reviewed these statistics at regular trials unit team meetings. We notified centres whose data return rate appeared to be falling, even if they had not yet crossed the pre-defined acceptability threshold of an 80% data return rate. We developed a set method for agreeing targets for gradual improvement with centres having persistent data return problems. We formalised a detailed escalation policy to manage centres who failed to meet agreed targets. We conducted a post-hoc, descriptive analysis of the effectiveness of the new processes. RESULTS: The new processes were used from April 2015 to September 2016. By May 2016, data return rates were higher than they had been at any time previously, and there were no centres with return rates below 80%, which had never been the case before. In total, 10 centres out of 35 were contacted regarding falling data return rates. Six out of these 10 showed improved rates within 6-8 weeks, and the remainder within 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results constitute preliminary effectiveness evidence for novel methods in monitoring and managing data return rates in randomised controlled trials.

Evidence of effectiveness of this digital communication is equivocal. There are gaps in evidence as to how it might work, its cost, and ethical and safety issues. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to understand how the use of digital communication between young people with long-term conditions and their NHS specialist clinicians changes engagement of the young people with their health care"," and to identify costs and necessary safeguards. METHODS: We conducted mixed-methods case studies of 20 NHS specialist clinical teams from across England and Wales and their practice providing care for 13 different long-term physical or mental health conditions. We observed 79 clinical team members and interviewed 165 young people aged 16-24 years with a long-term health condition recruited via case study clinical teams, 173 clinical team members, and 16 information governance specialists from study NHS Trusts. We conducted a thematic analysis of how digital communication works, and analyzed ethics, safety and governance, and annual direct costs. RESULTS: Young people and their clinical teams variously used mobile phone calls, text messages, email, and voice over Internet protocol. Length of clinician use of digital communication varied from 1 to 13 years in 17 case studies, and was being considered in 3. Digital communication enables timely access for young people to the right clinician at the time when it can make a difference to how they manage their health condition. This is valued as an addition to traditional clinic appointments and can engage those otherwise disengaged, particularly at times of change for young people. It can enhance patient autonomy, empowerment and activation. It challenges the nature and boundaries of therapeutic relationships but can improve trust. The clinical teams studied had not themselves formally evaluated the impact of their intervention. Staff time is the main cost driver, but offsetting savings are likely elsewhere in the health service. Risks include increased dependence on clinicians, inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, and communication failures, which are mostly mitigated by young people and clinicians using common-sense approaches. CONCLUSIONS: As NHS policy prompts more widespread use of digital communication to improve the health care experience, our findings suggest that benefit is most likely, and harms are mitigated, when digital communication is used with patients who already have a relationship of trust with the clinical team, and where there is identifiable need for patients to have flexible access, such as when transitioning between services, treatments, or lived context. Clinical teams need a proactive approach to ethics, governance, and patient safety."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/jmir.7154,Adolescent",Adult,*Communication,Delivery of Health Care,*Health Services,Humans,*Internet,

Subtypes of PADs include crisis cards, joint crisis plans, and self-binding directives (also known as Ulysses contracts). These instruments are intended to improve service user involvement and need orientation in the care of mental crises and to avoid traumatization through unwanted treatment. The existing evidence suggests that people who complete a PAD tend to work more cooperatively with their clinician and experience fewer involuntary hospital admissions. Nevertheless, PADs have not been successfully mainstreamed into care due to multiple barriers to the implementation of PADs, mainly around the completion of PADs and their accessibility and use in crises. The reasons for this include the lack of support in the completion process and acceptance problems, especially on the part of professionals. The research to date primarily recommends support for service users from facilitators, such as peer support workers, and training for all stakeholders. In this article, we argue that while these approaches can help to solve completion and acceptance challenges, they are not sufficient to ensure access to PADs in crises. To ensure accessibility, we propose digital PADs, which offer considerable potential for overcoming these aforementioned barriers. Embedded in national health data infrastructures, PADs could be completed and accessed by service users themselves, possibly with the support of facilitators, and retrieved by any clinic in an emergency. We highlight the strengths and limitations of digital PADs and point out that the proposed solutions must be developed collaboratively and take into account digital inequalities to be effective support for people with serious mental health conditions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/68549,Humans",*Advance Directives,*Electronic Health Records,"Mental Disorders/therapy,40100260,",,,,,

Under these circumstances, a framework involving groups representing various interests is needed to derive a reasonable solution to the dispute over the inclusion of gaming disorders in ICD-11. For this framework to work effectively, it is necessary to agree on consistent and advanced research findings that harms related to the excessive use of digital devices or content continue to occur empirically all over the world and that addictive use constitutes a primary addictive disorder. The problematic risk taking involving emerging technologies may include not only health risks from addictive use, but also more general harms associated with digital ethics and norms such as privacy and transparent money transactions. An understanding of a public health model of addiction is required to reduce harms associated with online addictive behavior that exist behind risk taking. Such harms are also mediated by excessive use, excessive money spending, and exposure to addictive content such as violence and pornography. Major stakeholders and their roles can be derived more effectively based on these conceptual models and parameters of harms.

Information and communication technology provides new opportunities for patients to actively become involved in research. These trends are particularly noticeable in Europe and the US, but less obvious in Japan. The aim of this study was to investigate the practice of active involvement of patients in medical research in Japan by utilizing a digital platform, and to analyze the outcomes to clarify what specific approaches could be put into practice. METHODS: We developed the RUDY JAPAN system, an ongoing rare disease medical research platform, in collaboration with the Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases Study (RUDY) project in the UK. After 2 years of preparation, RUDY JAPAN was launched in December 2017. Skeletal muscle channelopathies were initially selected as target diseases, and hereditary angioedema was subsequently added. Several approaches for active patient involvement were designed through patient-researcher collaboration, namely the Steering Committee, questionnaire development, dynamic consent, and other communication strategies. We analyzed our practices and experiences focusing on how each approach affected and contributed to the research project. RESULTS: RUDY JAPAN has successfully involved patients in this research project in various ways. While not a part of the initial decision-making phase to launch the project, patients have increasingly been involved since then. A high level of patient involvement was achieved through the Steering Committee, a governance body that has made a major contribution to RUDY JAPAN, and the process of the questionnaire development. The creation of the Patient Network Forum, website and newsletter cultivated dialogue between patients and researchers. The registry itself allowed patient participation through data input and control of data usage through dynamic consent. CONCLUSIONS: We believe the initial outcomes demonstrate the feasibility and utility of active patient involvement in Japan. The collaboration realized through RUDY JAPAN was enabled by digital technologies. It allowed busy patients and researchers to find the space to meet and work together for the Steering Committee, questionnaire development and various communication activities. While the practice of active patient involvement in Japan is still in its early stages, this research confirms its viability if the right conditions are in place.

However, the topic is complex and extremely sensitive, and best practices for research and harm reduction are yet to be defined. Drawing on cross-disciplinary approaches, such as co-design, is one way to achieve a better understanding of the issue among vulnerable young people and to create needs-based and evidence-informed digital resources to promote pornography literacy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to co-design a relevant, usable, and acceptable digital prototype to address the pornography literacy needs of vulnerable young people. METHODS: In total, 17 young people aged between 14 and 23 years who were engaged in youth services programs or alternative education programs were recruited to participate in 4 co-design workshops with a multidisciplinary design team. RESULTS: Although the participants could identify problems with pornography and critique its messages, they lacked the information to understand alternative healthy attitudes and behaviors. A digital resource that provides detailed and practical information about sex, sexual ethics, and relationships may help vulnerable young people to identify and contrast with any problematic messages they receive from both pornography and society. Embedding this information with pornography literacy messages may be a more effective way of addressing underlying attitudes. Acknowledging information-seeking patterns and leveraging user interaction patterns from commonly used digital platforms among users may enhance engagement with resources. Importantly, digital platforms are perceived among this group as a source of anonymous secondary information but would not be organically accessed among this group without face-to-face conversations as an access point. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights the potential for pornography literacy to be embedded within real and practical information about having sex, navigating sexuality, and healthy relationships.

Despite the potential benefits across diverse medical domains, a significant barrier to the successful adoption of AI systems in health care applications remains the prevailing low user trust in these technologies. Crucially, this challenge is exacerbated by the lack of consensus among experts from different disciplines on the definition of trust in AI within the health care sector. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide the first consensus-based analysis of trust in AI in health care based on an interdisciplinary panel of experts from different domains. Our findings can be used to address the problem of defining trust in AI in health care applications, fostering the discussion of concrete real-world health care scenarios in which humans interact with AI systems explicitly. METHODS: We used a combination of framework analysis and a 3-step consensus process involving 18 international experts from the fields of computer science, medicine, philosophy of technology, ethics, and social sciences. Our process consisted of a synchronous phase during an expert workshop where we discussed the notion of trust in AI in health care applications, defined an initial framework of important elements of trust to guide our analysis, and agreed on 5 case studies. This was followed by a 2-step iterative, asynchronous process in which the authors further developed, discussed, and refined notions of trust with respect to these specific cases. RESULTS: Our consensus process identified key contextual factors of trust, namely, an AI system's environment, the actors involved, and framing factors, and analyzed causes and effects of trust in AI in health care. Our findings revealed that certain factors were applicable across all discussed cases yet also pointed to the need for a fine-grained, multidisciplinary analysis bridging human-centered and technology-centered approaches. While regulatory boundaries and technological design features are critical to successful AI implementation in health care, ultimately, communication and positive lived experiences with AI systems will be at the forefront of user trust. Our expert consensus allowed us to formulate concrete recommendations for future research on trust in AI in health care applications. CONCLUSIONS: This paper advocates for a more refined and nuanced conceptual understanding of trust in the context of AI in health care. By synthesizing insights into commonalities and differences among specific case studies, this paper establishes a foundational basis for future debates and discussions on trusting AI in health care."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/56306,*Artificial Intelligence",*Trust,Humans,*Delivery of Health Care/standards,"*Consensus,39969962,PMC11888049",,,,

Alongside this development, social scientists have become increasingly incorporated into large-scale research and innovation projects to facilitate participatory spaces. This requires reflection on the mechanisms, outcomes and, ultimately, the accountabilities of participation. In this paper, we propose the lens of care framework for approaching such reflections. We illustrate its value by using it to account for our role in establishing participatory spaces as part of a European Horizon 2020-funded research and innovation project, entitled EmERGE. We describe the codesign processes we developed and implemented with the aim of enabling heterogeneous voices, distinct experiences and multiple ideas to be articulated to inform the development and implementation of a digital platform for HIV care. We show how the lens of care framework enables us to trouble participation along prior theoretical distinctions between patients/citizens roles, invited/uninvited spaces and inclusive/scientistic voices and provides novel lines of inquiry to capture the relational and emergent processes of participation in digital health innovation. In the EmERGE project, spaces of participation were co-created within and by the community, whose members skilfully arranged the material, social and temporal set-up. Within these spaces we were able to articulate voices, deliberate knowledge and study the potentialities of technology so that initial technological inscriptions of empowerment through information-push were challenged and were, eventually, replaced by more interactive forms of clinician-patient engagement in digital HIV care.

METHODS: We prospectively piloted a novel medical history documentation system in a German cardiological outpatient practice and evaluated its feasibility and perceived usefulness. Based on a generic software that allows to record structured information, a customized solution for the cooperating practice was developed and implemented. Prior to the consultation of the physician, the patient used a tablet that guided the user through a structured comprehensive workflow to document the medical history. The retrieved information was arranged by the software into a ready-to-use text format, presented to the physician in an editable form and added to her report. Three user-centered endpoints were explored: i) Appropriateness-measured by the duration of a patient interview", ii) Patient acceptance-assessed by three questions to patients," iii) Usefulness-operationalized by multiple ratings of the physician. RESULTS: A total of 2,513 patients were approached of which 2,415 provided complete histories. The system was assessed as appropriate for the practical workflow in terms of time and workflows. The patient-system interaction was rated favourably by patients including elderly ones. The system was regarded useful by the physician, reducing her daily workload by about one hour. CONCLUSIONS: Automated history-taking tools deployed before consultation could support physicians in obtaining patients' medical histories, thereby reducing professionals' perceived workload.

However, the meanings that eldercare personnel attach to welfare technology in the care of older recipients, and thus the domestication of welfare technology, remain largely underexplored. This study explores how eldercare personnel understand and ascribe meanings to welfare technologies in their daily work, with the aim of understanding their domestication. METHODS: The empirical material comprised 181 photographs, each paired with corresponding text, from 61 participants across four municipalities in southern Sweden. The empirical material was thematically analysed, focusing on different categories of welfare technologies and their ascribed meanings. In our coding """"convenience"""" and at times """"inconvenience"""" were interpreted as recurrent patterns. Their repeated presence across various contexts and the meanings ascribed to different welfare technologies prompted deeper interpretive engagement, leading us to adopt it as a key theme. In the final step, the codes were synthesised through the lens of """"convenience"""" to better understand the meanings participants attached to welfare technology in eldercare work. RESULTS: The participants ascribed meanings to welfare technology that resonate with broader societal and cultural understandings of technological solutionism, while aligning with national policies promoting welfare technology as a means of supporting safety, activity and independence for older adults. Welfare technology was often understood as both convenient and an act of care. Our analysis uncovered different dimensions of """"convenience"""", which we labelled as: """"remote surveillance convenience"""", """"logistics convenience"""", """"communication convenience"""", """"safety convenience"""", """"comforting convenience"""" and """"activation convenience"""". Yet, in some cases, welfare technology was also seen as a hindrance to care, being inconvenient due to its inflexibility, technical difficulties and the tendency to create duplicate tasks. CONCLUSION: This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the domestication of welfare technology in eldercare. Our study found that eldercare personnel engage with and interpret welfare technologies by ascribing meanings related to perceived convenience - a concept not widely explored in this context. Welfare technologies were often seen as convenient substitutes for physical proximity and relational care, such as """"remote surveillance convenience"""" through cameras and """"comforting convenience"""" via robotic pets. However, convenience, while central to the participants' experiences, should not be understood as inherently """"good"""" or positive but as part of the domestication process, shaped by socio-technical contexts and the political economy of eldercare, which prioritises effectiveness and efficiency. By shedding light on these dynamics, our study examines how the domestication of welfare technology is shaped by and reinforces broader discourses of technological solutionism, raising questions about its long-term impact on care practices."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-024-11924-x,Humans",Sweden,Aged,*Social Welfare,Female,Male,Health Services for the Aged,"Middle Aged,39658795,PMC11629506",

We then distill these lessons learned into 11 recommendations for future research consortia in the areas of planning, communication, informatics, and analytics. We recommend that planning and budgeting for data coordination activities occur as early as possible during consortium conceptualization and development to minimize downstream complications. We also find that clear, reciprocal, and continuous communication between consortium stakeholders and the DCC is equally important to maintaining a secure and centralized informatics ecosystem for pooling data.

The study focused on air kerma (K(a,r)) and air kerma area product (KAP) values categorized into fixed dose (radiography and fluoroscopy) and motion dose (rotational digital subtraction angiography) for frontal and lateral biplane devices. Using single and multiple regression analysis, model equations for PSD were developed based on data from a radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeter and five dose parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to consolidate the data, and multiple regression models were created using principal component scores. The results showed that rotational digital subtraction angiography had a minimal impact on PSD, whereas the K(a,r) value demonstrated higher accuracy in predicting PSD than KAP.

Developing countries, especially in their rural areas, suffer from a lack of healthcare facilities, poverty and high rate of illiteracy. Motivated by the huge socio-economic gap between the developed and the developing worlds, there have been several studies into the COVID-19 pandemic management in developing countries. However, none of these research works emphasised the health cultural beliefs of any developing economy as a basis for their recommendations. Specifically, this paper discusses the pandemic situation in Nigeria with emphasis on the prevalent health cultural beliefs of the citizens of the country, especially those living in rural communities. This is important because each local community defines a socio-ecological cluster of people who are more tightly knitted together in terms of language, relationship, culture, religion, social amenities, business, leadership and so on. As such, there is a need to prepare the socio-ecological units to be more resistant to the spread of the virus"," a weaker social-ecological unit will entail a higher risk of community transmissions.

However, the rapid proliferation of teletherapy apps has occurred in an environment in which development has outpaced the various regulatory and ethical considerations of this space. Thus, researchers have raised concerns about the ethical implications and potential risks of teletherapy apps given the lack of regulation and oversight. Teletherapy apps have distinct aims to more directly replicate practices of traditional care, as opposed to mental health apps, which primarily provide supplemental support, suggesting a need to examine the ethical considerations of teletherapy apps from the lens of existing ethical guidelines for providing therapy. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined user reviews of commercial teletherapy apps to understand user perceptions of whether and how ethical principles are followed and incorporated. METHODS: We identified 8 mobile apps that (1) provided teletherapy on 2 dominant mobile app stores (Google Play and Apple App Store) and (2) had received >5000 app reviews on both app stores. We wrote Python scripts (Python Software Foundation) to scrape user reviews from the 8 apps, collecting 3268 user reviews combined across 2 app stores. We used thematic analysis to qualitatively analyze user reviews, developing a codebook drawing from the ethical codes of conduct for psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers. RESULTS: The qualitative analysis of user reviews revealed the ethical concerns and opportunities of teletherapy app users. Users frequently perceived unprofessionalism in their teletherapists, mentioning that their therapists did not listen to them, were distracted during therapy sessions, and did not keep their appointments. Users also noted technical glitches and therapist unavailability on teletherapy apps that might affect their ability to provide continuity of care. Users held varied opinions on the affordability of those apps, with some perceiving them as affordable and others not. Users further brought up that the subscription model resulted in unfair pricing and expressed concerns about the lack of cost transparency. Users perceived that these apps could help promote access to care by overcoming geographical and social constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that users perceive commercial teletherapy apps as adhering to many ethical principles pertaining to therapy but falling short in key areas regarding professionalism, continuity of care, cost fairness, and cost transparency. Our findings suggest that, to provide high-quality care, teletherapy apps should prioritize fair compensation for therapists, develop more flexible and transparent payment models, and invest in measures to ensure app stability and therapist availability. Future work is needed to develop standards for teletherapy and improve the quality and accessibility of those services."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/49684,"""",37738085,PMC10559192",,,,,,,,

However, this requires low-template whole genome amplification (WGA) that is prone to errors and biases from uneven amplifications. Currently, quality control (QC) methods for WGA products, as well as the number of CTCs needed for reliable downstream sequencing, remain poorly defined. We sought to define strategies for selecting and generating optimal WGA products from low-template input as it relates to their potential applications in precision oncology strategies. METHODS: Single pancreatic cancer cells (HPAF-II) were isolated using laser microdissection. WGA was performed using multiple displacement amplification (MDA), multiple annealing and looping based amplification (MALBAC) and PicoPLEX. Quality of amplified DNA products were assessed using a multiplex/RT-qPCR based method that evaluates for 8-cancer related genes and QC-scores were assigned. We utilized this scoring system to assess the impact of de novo modifications to the WGA protocol. WGA products were subjected to Sanger sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate their performances in respective downstream analyses providing validation of the QC-score. RESULTS: Single-cell WGA products exhibited a significant sample-to-sample variability in amplified DNA quality as assessed by our 8-gene QC assay. Single-cell WGA products that passed the pre-analysis QC had lower amplification bias and improved aCGH/NGS performance metrics when compared to single-cell WGA products that failed the QC. Increasing the number of cellular input resulted in improved QC-scores overall, but a resultant WGA product that consistently passed the QC step required a starting cellular input of at least 20-cells. Our modified-WGA protocol effectively reduced this number, achieving reproducible high-quality WGA products from =5-cells as a starting template. A starting cellular input of 5 to 10-cells amplified using the modified-WGA achieved aCGH and NGS results that closely matched that of unamplified, batch genomic DNA. CONCLUSION: The modified-WGA protocol coupled with the 8-gene QC serve as an effective strategy to enhance the quality of low-template WGA reactions. Furthermore, a threshold number of 5-10 cells are likely needed for a reliable WGA reaction and product with high fidelity to the original starting template."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12885-017-3447-6,""Biomarkers, Tumor",Cell Line,Comparative Genomic Hybridization,Computational Biology/methods,DNA Mutational Analysis,"Genome, Human",*Genomics/methods/standards,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,

However, their performance still remains a matter of concern. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using ML methodologies on CVD prediction, especially compared to established risk tool, the HellenicSCORE. METHODS: Data from the ATTICA prospective study (n = 2020 adults), enrolled during 2001-02 and followed-up in 2011-12 were used. Three different machine-learning classifiers (k-NN, random forest, and decision tree) were trained and evaluated against 10-year CVD incidence, in comparison with the HellenicSCORE tool (a calibration of the ESC SCORE). Training datasets, consisting from 16 variables to only 5 variables, were chosen, with or without bootstrapping, in an attempt to achieve the best overall performance for the machine learning classifiers. RESULTS: Depending on the classifier and the training dataset the outcome varied in efficiency but was comparable between the two methodological approaches. In particular, the HellenicSCORE showed accuracy 85%, specificity 20%, sensitivity 97%, positive predictive value 87%, and negative predictive value 58%, whereas for the machine learning methodologies, accuracy ranged from 65 to 84%, specificity from 46 to 56%, sensitivity from 67 to 89%, positive predictive value from 89 to 91%, and negative predictive value from 24 to 45%"," random forest gave the best results, while the k-NN gave the poorest results. CONCLUSIONS: The alternative approach of machine learning classification produced results comparable to that of risk prediction scores and, thus, it can be used as a method of CVD prediction, taking into consideration the advantages that machine learning methodologies may offer."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-018-0644-1,""Adult",*Algorithms,Blood Pressure/physiology,Cardiovascular Diseases/*diagnosis/physiopathology,Female,Humans,*Machine Learning,

Short message service (SMS) technologies offer promise, with several large-scale SMS-based implementations already under way. Still largely lacking in the research literature are evaluations of specific ethical issues that arise when SMS programs are implemented and studied in resource-limited settings. In this paper, we examine the ethical issues raised by the deployment of SMS messaging to support patient retention in HIV care and treatment and in the research conducted to evaluate that deployment. We use case studies that are based in Mozambique and ground our discussion in the ethical framework for international research proposed by Emanuel et al., highlighting ethical considerations needed to guide the design and implementation of future SMS-based interventions. Such guidance is increasingly needed in countries such as Mozambique, where the local capacity for ethical study design and oversight is still limited and the scale-up and study of mHealth initiatives are still driven predominantly by international collaborators. These issues can be complex and will need ongoing attention on a case-by-case basis to ensure that appropriate protections are in place, while simultaneously maximizing the potential benefit of new mHealth technologies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1093/jamia/ocx123,""Case-Control Studies",Cell Phone,Confidentiality,Developing Countries,"*Ethics, Medical",HIV Infections/*therapy,Health Resources,Humans,

METHODS: In a quasirandomised study (n=3095), we recruited consenting adults with undiagnosed HIV infection from township clinics. To the HIVST arm participants (n=1535), we offered a choice of an offsite (home, office or kiosk based), unsupervised digital HIVST program (n=962), or an onsite, clinic-based, supervised digital HIVST program (n=573) with 24/7 linkages services.With propensity score analyses, we compared outcomes (ie, linkages, new HIV infections and test referrals) with conventional HIV testing (ConvHT) arm participants (n=1560), recruited randomly from geographically separated clinics. RESULTS: In both arms, participants were young (HIVST vs ConvHT) (mean age: 28.2 years vs 29.2 years), female (65.0% vs 76.0%) and had monthly income <3000 rand (80.8% vs 75%).Participants chose unsupervised HIVST (62.7%) versus supervised HIVST and reported multiple sex partners (10.88% vs 8.7%), exposure to sex workers (1.4% vs 0.2%) and fewer comorbidities (0.9% vs 1.9%).

It is essential as a pre-screening process because it can greatly reduce the scope of possible bacterial species and will make the subsequent identification more specific and increase work efficiency in clinical bacteriology. But this work needs adequate clinical laboratory expertise of bacterial colony morphology, which is especially difficult for beginners to handle properly. This study presents automatic programs for bacterial colony classification task, by applying the deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), which has a widespread use of digital imaging data analysis in hospitals. The most common 18 bacterial colony classes from Peking University First Hospital were used to train this framework, and other images out of these training dataset were utilized to test the performance of this classifier. RESULTS: The feasibility of this framework was verified by the comparison between predicted result and standard bacterial category. The classification accuracy of all 18 bacteria can reach 73%, and the accuracy and specificity of each kind of bacteria can reach as high as 90%.

We compared the fraction of patients with sufficient clinical data obtained using computerized history taking software (CHT) versus physician-acquired medical history to calculate established risk scores and assessed the patient-by-patient agreement between these 2 ways of obtaining medical history information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of clinically stable patients aged = 18 years presenting to the emergency department (ED) at Danderyd University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) in 2017-2019 with acute chest pain and non-diagnostic ECG and serum markers. Medical histories were self-reported using CHT on a tablet. Observations on discrete variables in the risk scores were extracted from electronic health records (EHR) and the CHT database. The patient-by-patient agreement was described by Cohen's kappa statistics. RESULTS: Of the total 1000 patients included (mean age 55.3 ± 17.4 years"," 54% women), HEART score, EDACS, and T-MACS could be calculated in 75%, 74%, and 83% by CHT and in 31%, 7%, and 25% by EHR, respectively. The agreement between CHT and EHR was slight to moderate (kappa 0.19-0.70) for chest pain characteristics and moderate to almost perfect (kappa 0.55-0.91) for risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: CHT can acquire and document data for chest pain risk stratification in most ED patients using established risk scores, achieving this goal for a substantially larger number of patients, as compared to EHR data. The agreement between CHT and physician-acquired history taking is high for traditional risk factors and lower for chest pain characteristics.

New behaviours and tasks emerged due to changes of roles, work processes and responsibilities. The study investigates effects of digital transformation, in this case how video visits in outpatient care change work processes and introduces new tasks, in order to further improve the concept of video visits. OBJECTIVE: Through real-time, social interactional features of preparing for and conducting video visits, the study examines clinicians' perceived limitations and disturbances, and how the conditions between patients and clinicians may change when using video visits instead of face-to-face meetings in outpatient care. METHODS: Qualitative methods have been used including 14 observations of video visits at two different clinics and 14 followup interviews with clinicians. Transcriptions of interviews and field notes were thematically analysed, discussed and synthesised into themes. RESULTS: Disturbances and limitations related to the technology were related to time"," a flexibility to schedule the meeting unbound of place, frustrations when the other part was late for the scheduled meeting, and that more experienced users of video visits usually waited longer before logging in. They were also related to sound"," problems getting the sound to work satisfactory during the video visits, and problems with the image. Disturbances and limitations related to the surroundings were related to both the patient's and the clinician's environment"," the principle of video technology in itself may affect the experience and the content of the consultation, and the surrounding chosen changes the conditions for and reduces the participants' field of view. CONCLUSIONS: We could see 1) a transformation of roles and responsibilities when turning from face-to-face meetings to video visits, 2) that video visits add new circumstances, with a risk of introducing disturbances and limitations, that in turn affects the content of the meeting, 3) that avoiding negative disturbances during a video visit, requires a sensibility from the clinician's side as well as a trust in the patient's judgement, 4) that both expected and unexpected disturbances and limitations during a video visit affect the clinician's behaviour, feelings, the content of the meeting and how the clinician's relate to the different components of the concept, and 5) that there is a change of roles introduced when conducting video visits, eg, the clinician taking the first line support if both (s)he and the patient encounter problems with the technology."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/jmir.9866,Adult",Ambulatory Care/*methods,Female,Humans,Male,

AIM: This study aims to assess the readiness of nursing leaders for AI integration and evaluate their perceptions of the benefits of AI-driven predictive analytics in healthcare. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 187 nurse leaders across nine private hospitals in Cairo. The sample was selected using a combination of simple random sampling and non-probability convenience sampling methods to ensure a diverse representation of nursing leadership. Data collection took place from March to May 2024, utilizing a structured questionnaire specifically designed to assess nurse leaders' readiness for AI integration and their perceptions of AI-driven predictive analytics The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26.0.

METHODS: This study used an ethnographic approach to critically examine the role of digital technology in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic governance. Three months of participant observation and 20 interviews were conducted to understand the design of Health Code and the situation of homeless population. RESULTS: We find that China's digital health surveillance during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has failed to cover the homeless population, who either fail to access Health Code or find ways to avoid its mandatory health surveillance. We further summarize four problems resulting in their exclusion, including the loss of ID cards, access to smartphones and phone numbers, problematic design and elastic surveillance, and the neglect of homeless community's precarious living situation. CONCLUSION: Situating our work in the literature on theories of surveillance and anthropology of pandemics, we argue that without recognizing the structural problems embedded in homelessness, a large number of poor and homeless migrants are rendered invisible in this data-driven health surveillance, which further pushes them into social exclusion."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1177/20552076231170689,"""",37124328,PMC10134151",,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to present examples of action opportunities for (1) designing """"technology"""""," (2) shaping the """"context"""" of use"," and (3) adjusting the behavior of """"users"""" to guide responsible digital care for people with intellectual disabilities. METHODS: Three cases were considered: (1) design of a web application to support the preparation of meals for groups of people with intellectual disabilities, (2) implementation of an app to help people with intellectual disabilities regulate their stress independently, and (3) implementation of a social robot to stimulate interaction and physical activity among people with intellectual disabilities. Overall, 26 stakeholders participated in 3 multistakeholder workshops (case 1: 10/26, 38%"," case 2: 10/26, 38%"," case 3: 6/26, 23%) based on the """"guidance ethics approach."""" We identified stakeholders' values based on bottom-up exploration of experienced and expected effects of using the technology, and we formulated action opportunities for these values in the specific context of use. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Overall, 232 effects, 33 values, and 156 action opportunities were collected. General and case-specific themes were identified. Important stakeholder values included quality of care, autonomy, efficiency, health, enjoyment, reliability, and privacy. Both positive and negative effects could underlie stakeholders' values and influence the development of action opportunities. Action opportunities comprised the following: (1) technology: development of the technology (eg, user experience and customization), technology input (eg, recipes for meals, intervention options for reducing stress, and activities), and technology output (eg, storage and use of data)"," (2) context: guidelines, training and support, policy or agreements, and adjusting the physical environment in which the technology is used"," and (3) users: integrating the technology into daily care practice, by diminishing (eg, """"letting go"""" to increase the autonomy of people with intellectual disabilities), retaining (eg, face-to-face contact), and adding (eg, evaluation moments) certain behaviors of care professionals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide insight into responsible digital care for people with intellectual disabilities by means of bottom-up exploration of action opportunities to take account of stakeholders' values in designing technology, shaping the context of use, and adjusting the behavior of users. Although part of the findings may be generalized, case-specific insights and a complementary top-down approach (eg, predefined ethical frameworks) are essential. The findings represent a part of an ethical discourse that requires follow-up to meet the dynamism of stakeholders' values and further develop and implement action opportunities to achieve socially desirable, ethically acceptable, and sustainable digital care that improves the lives of people with intellectual disabilities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/48147,Humans",*Intellectual Disability/therapy,

Identifying such epitopes is useful for molecular understanding of cellular immune responses and can guide the development of personalized vaccines for various diseases including cancer. For a few hundred common human and mouse MHC-I alleles, large datasets of ligands are available and machine learning MHC-I ligand predictors trained on such data reach high prediction accuracy. However, for the vast majority of other MHC-I alleles, no ligand is known. METHODS: We capitalize on an expanded architecture of our MHC-I ligand predictor (MixMHCpred3.0) to systematically assess the extent to which predictions of MHC-I ligands can be applied to MHC-I alleles that currently lack known ligand data. RESULTS: Our results reveal high prediction accuracy for most MHC-I alleles in human and in laboratory mouse strains, but significantly lower accuracy in other species. Our work further outlines some of the molecular determinants of MHC-I ligand prediction accuracy across alleles and species. Robust benchmarking on external data shows that our MHC-I ligand predictor demonstrates competitive performance relative to other state-of-the-art MHC-I ligand predictors and can be used for CD8() T-cell epitope predictions.

To date, most frameworks take the format of text-only documents that outline and offer ethical guidance on specific contexts. This study's goal was to determine whether an interactive-visual format supports frameworks in transferring ethical knowledge by improving learning, deliberation, and user experience. METHODS: An experimental comparative study was conducted with a pre-, mid-, and post-test design using the online survey platform Qualtrics. Participants were university based early-stage health researchers who were randomly assigned to either the control condition (text-only document) or the experimental condition (interactive-visual). The primary outcome variables were learning, (measured using a questionnaire), deliberation (using cases studies) and user experience (measured using the SED/UD Scale). Analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and mixed-effects linear regression. RESULTS: Of the 80 participants, 44 (55%) used the text-only document and 36 (45%) used the interactive-visual. Results of the knowledge-test scores showed a statistically significant difference between participants' post-test scores, indicating that the interactive-visual format better supported understanding, acquisition, and application of the framework's knowledge. Findings from the case studies showed both formats supported ethical deliberation. Results further indicated the interactive-visual provided an overall better episodic and remembered user experience compared with the text-only document. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that ethical frameworks formatted with interactive and visual qualities provide a more pleasing user experience and are effective formats for ethics learning and deliberation. These findings have implications for practitioners developing and deploying ethical frameworks and guidelines (e.g., in educational or employee-onboarding settings), in that the knowledge generated can lead to more effective dissemination practices of normative guidelines and health data ethics concepts."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1080/23294515.2023.2201479,Humans",*Learning,"*Bioethics,37074681,",,,,,,

METHODS: We developed a network of expertise and capabilities to rapidly develop and deploy an institutional-level interdisciplinary LHS. Based upon a scoping review of the literature and the Knowledge to Action Framework, we adopted a LHS framework identifying contributors and components necessary to developing a system within and between the university academic and medical centers. We used social network analysis to examine the emergence of informal work patterns and diversified network capabilities based on the LHS framework. RESULTS: This experience report details three principal characteristics of the UAB COVID-19 CORE LHS development: (a) identifying network contributors and components", (b) building the institutional network," and (c) diversifying network capabilities. Contributors and committees were identified from seven components of LHS: (a) collaborative and executive leadership committee, (b) research coordinating committee, (c) oversight and ethics committee, (d) thematic scientific working groups, (e) programmatic working groups, (f) informatics capabilities, and (g) patient advisory groups. Evolving from the topical interests of the initial CORE participants, scientific working groups emerged to support the learning system network. Programmatic working groups were charged with developing a comprehensive and mutually accessible COVID-19 database. DISCUSSION: Our LHS framework allowed for effective integration of multiple academic and medical centers into a cohesive institutional-level learning system. Network analysis indicated diversity of institutional disciplines, professional rank, and topical focus pertaining to COVID-19, with each center leveraging existing institutional responsibilities to minimize gaps in network capabilities.

Not surprisingly, many of the technologies developed for the use of older adults focus on care. The exclusion of older adults from the research and design of digital technology is often based on such negative stereotypes.

Some remarkable developments have taken place in the domain of image classification tasks in areas such as digital pathology and diagnostic radiology. The application of ML approaches to the analysis of DNA data, including tumor-derived genomic profiles, microRNAs, and cancer epigenetic signatures, while relatively more recent, has demonstrated some utility in identifying driver variants and molecular signatures with possible prognostic and therapeutic applications. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with academic and clinical experts to capture the status quo, challenges, opportunities, ethical implications, and future directions. RESULTS: Our participants agreed that machine learning in precision oncology is in infant stages, with clinical integration still rare. Overall, participants equated ongoing developments with better clinical workflows and improved treatment decisions for more cancer patients. They underscored the ability of machine learning to tackle the dynamic nature of cancer, break down the complexity of molecular data, and support decision-making. Our participants emphasized obstacles related to molecular data access, clinical utility, and guidelines. The availability of reliable and well-curated data to train and validate machine learning algorithms and integrate multiple data sources were described as constraints yet necessary for future clinical implementation.

Research Question/Hypothesis: Our experience with genomics provides a lens to facilitate the way we navigate toward a future health data space. Contemporary and innovative legal and ethical models can be applied to concepts of privacy, ownership, and consent in relation to big data. SIGNIFICANCE: Technological innovation has transformed healthcare at a faster rate than legal reform, security measures, and consent policies can adapt. The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has been recognized as a work in progress, with respect to big data as it relates to healthcare and individual wellbeing. The shortcomings of HIPAA, and its application to big data, can be paralleled with its prior limitations surrounding genomics in the last two decades. The Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act (2008) and Genomic Data Sharing Policy (2015) were established to overcome HIPAA's inadequacies concerning genetic discrimination and security. These policies can serve as a basic model for our approach to legislative reform as it relates to privacy risks with big data generated in healthcare and from healthy individuals in society who are not patients. In addition to notions of privacy, concepts of ownership and consent have become increasingly vague and opaque. The technological advancements have facilitated access and transmission of information, such that big data can be sold for financial gain for commercial enterprise. This applies to genomics, with companies like 23andMe, in addition to big data, as it relates to big tech giants like Apple or Google who oversee wearable and search term data. Clarity of ownership within a digital healthcare arena needs to be defined through ethical and legal frameworks at a global level. APPROACH: A narrative review of the literature published between 2010 and 2021 was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles discussing privacy, security, ownership, big data, and genomics were included as relevant literature. IMPORTANCE: As a society, we are at a crossroads"," we must determine the extent of privacy that we are willing to give for science and society. We cannot continue with the current status quo in hope that individual will be used for the greater good of society.

Comparisons between telehealth and in-person health-care tend to focus on measures of patient satisfaction rather than qualitative changes in treatment relationships. Media scholar Silverstone (Digital media revisited: Theoretical and conceptual innovations in digital domains, MIT Press, 2003) uses the term 'proper distance' to theorise how ethical relationships are mediated by technology. Drawing on this concept, we explore how patients and health-care practitioners understand telehealth as affecting distance and proximity. We find that both groups express some ambivalence about the impact of telehealth on relationships, on the one hand expecting and privileging simple, transactional relationships, and on the other hand, expressing concerns about the loss of more intimate relationships in health care and about 'missing something' while providing health care.

Social media has changed traditional one-to-one communication between doctors and patients to many-to-many communication between doctors and consumers. However, little is known about the effect of doctor-consumer interaction on consumers' health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how doctor-consumer interaction in social media affects consumers' health behaviors. METHODS: On the basis of professional-client interaction theory and social cognitive theory, we propose that doctor-consumer interaction can be divided into instrumental interaction and affective interaction. These two types of interactions influence consumers' health behaviors through declarative knowledge (DK), self-efficacy (SE), and outcome expectancy (OE). To validate our proposed research model, we employed the survey method and developed corresponding measurement instruments for constructs in our research model. A total of 352 valid answers were collected, and partial least square was performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: Instrumental doctor-consumer interaction was found to influence consumers' DK (t(294)=5.763, P<.001), SE (t(294)=4.891, P<.001), and OE (t(294)=7.554, P<.001) significantly, whereas affective doctor-consumer interaction also impacted consumers' DK (t(294)=4.025, P<.001), SE (t(294)=4.775, P<.001), and OE (t(294)=4.855, P<.001). Meanwhile, consumers' DK (t(294)=3.838, P<.001), SE (t(294)=3.824, P<.001), and OE (t(294)=2.985, P<.01) all significantly affected consumers' health behaviors. Our mediation analysis showed that consumers' DK, SE, and OE partially mediated the effect of instrumental interaction on health behaviors, whereas the three mediators fully mediated the effect of affective interaction on health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with many intentional intervention programs, doctor-consumer interaction can be treated as a natural cost-effective intervention to promote consumers' health behaviors. Meanwhile, both instrumental and affective interaction should be highlighted for the best interaction results. DK, SE, and OE are working mechanisms of doctor-consumer interaction."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/jmir.9003,Adult",Communication,*Consumer Behavior,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Health Behavior/*physiology,Humans,Male,

Additionally, the study aims to identify sources contributing to variance in these measurement approaches. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy individuals exhibiting normal occlusion were enrolled in this clinical trial. The SCI was delineated using a virtual articulator (VA) by aligning IOS with both CBCT and FS, creating two distinct workflows labeled CBCT-IOS and FS-IOS, respectively. Concurrently, SCI measurements were also acquired using a JMA. The normality of data distribution for the difference in bilateral SCI measurements within each workflow was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Depending on the outcomes of this test, we utilized either a paired-sample T-test or Wilcoxon test for bilateral SCI comparisons. The inter-workflow differences were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Bland-Altman plots were assess the interchangeability and consistency across each pair of digital methods and to evaluate the aggregate consistency among the trio of digital approaches. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that the CBCT-IOS workflow yielded the lowest average SCI measurements, whereas the JMA workflow produced the highest values. No significant differences were found in the SCI measurements between the left and right sides obtained by CBCT-IOS and JMA (P > .05), with the exception of the FS-IOS workflow (P = .002). Additionally, inter-flow comparisons revealed no significant differences in SCI measurements (P > .05), except when contrasting the SCI as measured by CBCT-IOS and JMA (P = .0131). The Bland-Altman plots demonstrated a high degree of consistency and 95% limits of agreement across the three digital workflows.

We have recently seen global initiatives to produce online activities in an effort to scale up learning opportunities through learning management systems and massive open online courses for both undergraduate and continued professional education. Despite the positive impact of such efforts, factors such as cost, time, resources, and the specificity of educational contexts restrict the design and exchange of online medical educational activities. OBJECTIVE: The goal is to address the stated issues within the health professions education context while promoting learning by proposing the Online Learning Activities for Medical Education (OLAmeD) concept which builds on unified competency frameworks and generic technical standards for education. METHODS: We outline how frameworks used to describe a set of competencies for a specific topic in medical education across medical schools in the United States and Europe can be compared to identify commonalities that could result in a unified set of competencies representing both contexts adequately. Further, we examine how technical standards could be used to allow standardization, seamless sharing, and reusability of educational content. RESULTS: The entire process of developing and sharing OLAmeD is structured and presented in a set of steps using as example Urology as a part of clinical surgery specialization.

Digital health tools could offer innovative solutions to address these issues by providing personalized support, tracking, and mental health interventions. AIM: This study investigates the impact of digital health tools on the quality of life (QoL) and psychological adjustment of long-term blood donors in Saudi Arabia, with attention to demographic factors influencing engagement and perceptions. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 498 long-term blood donors aged 18-60, recruited from blood donation centers across Saudi Arabia. Participants were recruited through social media platforms, university networks, and professional organizations to ensure a diverse sample in terms of background, long-term donation history (more than 10 times), and daily digital usage habits. Participants completed an online questionnaire incorporating the WHO Quality of Life-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) and Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Brief-COPE) inventory to assess QoL and coping mechanisms. Descriptive statistics, two-sample t-tests, and ANOVA analyses were performed to examine differences in perceptions based on age, gender, and educational level. RESULTS: The findings indicate a generally positive perception of digital health tools, with mean QoL scores for self-distraction (Mean ± SD: 3.33 ± 0.97), active coping (3.29 ± 0.97), and psychological well-being (3.31 ± 0.82). Significant differences were observed across age groups, with older participants reporting higher perceived benefits ( p < .0001). Gender differences were also significant, with females showing higher mean scores in psychological adjustment factors such as active coping (3.75 ± 0.62) compared to males (2.8 ± 0.81), p < .0001. CONCLUSION: Digital health tools are perceived as beneficial for supporting QoL and psychological adjustment among blood donors, particularly for emotional and health management. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and education play a significant role in shaping these perceptions, highlighting the need for tailored interventions. Further research should explore longitudinal impacts to inform the design of more effective, culturally aligned digital health solutions for donor support."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.75123,"""",39759647,PMC11699197",,,,,,,,

Research suggests that the public is amenable to the use of anonymized CDRs for research"," however, further work is needed to show that such data can be used appropriately. This study works toward an ethically founded data governance framework with social acceptability. Using a multifaceted approach, this study draws upon data governance arrangements in published health research using CDRs, with a consideration of public views and the public's information expectations from mobile network operators, and data use scenarios of CDRs in health research. The findings were considered against a backdrop of legislative and regulatory requirements. CDRs can be used at various levels of data and geographic granularity and may be integrated with additional, publicly available or restricted datasets. As such, there may be a significant risk of identity disclosure, which must be mitigated with proportionate control measures. An indicative relative risk of the disclosure model is proposed to aid this process. Subsequently, a set of recommendations is presented, including the need for greater transparency, accountability, and incorporation of public views for social acceptability. This study addresses the need for greater clarity and consistency in data governance for CDRs in health research. While recognizing the need to protect commercial interests, we propose that these recommendations be used to contribute toward an ethically founded practical framework to promote the safe, socially acceptable use of CDR data for public benefit.

Diabetes mellitus accounts for 10% of NHS expenditure (£14B annually). Good self-management may improve health outcomes. NHS policy is to refer all people with T2DM to structured education, on diagnosis, to improve their self-management skills, with annual reinforcement thereafter. However, uptake remains low (5.6% in 2014?15). Almost all structured education is group based, which may not suit people who work, who have family or other caring commitments or who simply do not like group-based formats. Moreover, patient needs vary with time and a single education session at diagnosis is unlikely to meet these evolving needs. A web-based programme may increase uptake. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to develop, evaluate and implement a web-based self-management programme for people with T2DM at any stage of their illness journey, with the goal of improving access to, and uptake of, self-management support, thereby improving health outcomes in a cost-effective manner. Specific objectives were to (1) develop an evidence-based theoretically informed programme that was acceptable to patients and health-care professionals (HCPs) and that could be readily implemented within routine NHS care, (2) determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the programme compared with usual care and (3) determine how best to integrate the programme into routine care. DESIGN: There were five linked work packages (WPs). WP A determined patient requirements and WP B determined HCP requirements for the self-management programme. WP C developed and user-tested the Healthy Living for People with type 2 Diabetes (HeLP-Diabetes) programme. WP D was an individually randomised controlled trial in primary care with a health economic analysis. WP E used a mixed-methods and case-study design to study the potential for implementing the HeLP-Diabetes programme within routine NHS practice. SETTING: English primary care. PARTICIPANTS: People with T2DM (WPs A, D and E) or HCPs caring for people with T2DM (WPs B, C and E). INTERVENTION: The HeLP-Diabetes programme"," an evidence-based theoretically informed web-based self-management programme for people with T2DM at all stages of their illness journey, developed using participatory design principles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WPs A and B provided data on user ?wants and needs?, including factors that would improve the uptake and accessibility of the HeLP-Diabetes programme. The outcome for WP C was the HeLP-Diabetes programme itself. The trial (WP D) had two outcomes measures: glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) level and diabetes mellitus-related distress, as measured with the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale. The implementation outcomes (WP E) were the adoption and uptake at clinical commissioning group, general practice and patient levels and the identification of key barriers and facilitators. RESULTS: Data from WPs A and B supported our holistic approach and addressed all areas of self-management (medical, emotional and role management). HCPs voiced concerns about linkage with the electronic medical records (EMRs) and supporting patients to use the programme. The HeLP-Diabetes programme was developed and user-tested in WP C. The trial (WP D) recruited to target (n = 374), achieved follow-up rates of over 80% and the intention-to-treat analysis showed that there was an additional improvement in HbA(1c) levels at 12 months in the intervention group [mean difference ?0.24%, 95% confidence interval (CI) ?0.44% to ?0.049%]. There was no difference in overall PAID score levels (mean difference ?1.5 points, 95% CI ?3.9 to 0.9 points). The within-trial health economic analysis found that incremental costs were lower in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference ?£111, 95% CI ?£384 to £136) and the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were higher (mean difference 0.02 QALYs, 95% CI 0.000 to 0.044 QALYs), meaning that the HeLP-Diabetes programme group dominated the control group. In WP E, we found that the HeLP-Diabetes programme could be successfully implemented in primary care. General practices that supported people in registering for the HeLP-Diabetes programme had better uptake and registered patients from a wider demographic than those relying on patient self-registration. Some HCPs were reluctant to do this, as they did not see it as part of their professional role. LIMITATIONS: We were unable to link the HeLP-Diabetes programme with the EMRs or to determine the effects of the HeLP-Diabetes programme on users in the implementation study. CONCLUSIONS: The HeLP-Diabetes programme is an effective self-management support programme that is implementable in primary care. FUTURE WORK: The HeLP-Diabetes research team will explore the following in future work: research to determine how to improve patient uptake of self-management support", develop and evaluate a structured digital educational pathway for newly diagnosed people, develop and evaluate a digital T2DM prevention programme, and the national implementation of the HeLP-Diabetes programme.

A field in which this has become particularly salient is digitized EU border management. Here, the framework of responsible research and innovation (RRI) has recently been used to point to the alleged sensitivity of political actors towards the contingent dimensions of emerging security technologies. RRI, in general, is concerned with societal needs and the engagement and inclusion of various stakeholder groups in the research and innovation processes, aiming to anticipate undesired consequences of and identifying socially acceptable alternatives for emerging technologies. However, RRI has also been criticized as an industry-driven attempt to gain societal legitimacy for new technologies. In this article, we argue that while RRI evokes a space where different actors enter co-creative dialogues, it lays bare the specific challenges of governing security innovation in socially responsible ways. Empirically, we draw on the case study of BODEGA, the first EU funded research project to apply the RRI framework to the field of border security. We show how stakeholders involved in the project represent their work in relation to RRI and the resulting benefits and challenges they face. The paper argues that applying the framework to the field of (border) security lays bare its limitations, namely that RRI itself embodies a political agenda, conceals alternative experiences by those on whom security is enacted upon and that its key propositions of openness and transparency are hardly met in practice due to confidentiality agreements. Our hope is to contribute to work on RRI and emerging debates about how the concept can (or cannot) be contextualized for the field of security-a field that might be more in need than any other to consider the ethical dimension of its activities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11948-021-00292-y,""*Ethics, Research","Humans"",33599880,PMC7892741",,,,,,,

People with chronic conditions may spend many hours per year in health and social care services, but the majority of time is spent in self-care. This has implications in how health care is best organized. The term co-care specifically stresses the combination of health care professionals' and patients' resources, supported by appropriate (digital) tools for information exchange, to achieve the best possible health outcomes for patients. Developers of electronic health (eHealth) services need to consider both parties' specific needs for the service to be successful. Research on participants' experiences of participating in co-design sessions is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe different stakeholders' (people with chronic conditions, health care professionals, and facilitators) overall experiences of participating in co-design workshops aimed at designing an eHealth service for co-care for Parkinson disease, with a particular focus on the perceptions of values and challenges of co-design as well as improvement suggestions. METHODS: We conducted 4 half-day co-design workshops with 7 people with Parkinson disease and 9 health care professionals. Data were collected during the workshop series using formative evaluations with participants and facilitators after each workshop, researchers' diary notes throughout the co-design process, and a Web-based questionnaire after the final workshop. Quantitative data from the questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were triangulated and analyzed inductively using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Quantitative ratings showed that most participants had a positive general experience of the co-design workshops. Qualitative analysis resulted in 6 categories and 30 subcategories describing respondents' perceptions of the values and challenges of co-design and their improvement suggestions. The categories concerned (1) desire for more stakeholder variation", (2) imbalance in the collaboration between stakeholders, (3) time investment and commitment paradox, (4) desire for both flexibility and guidance," (5) relevant workshop content, but concerns about goal achievement"," and (6) hopes and doubts about future care. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the identified values and challenges, some paradoxical experiences were revealed, including (1) a desire to involve more stakeholders in co-design, while preferring to work in separate groups"," (2) a desire for more preparation and discussions, while the required time investment was a concern"," and (3) the experience that co-design is valuable for improving care, while there are doubts about the realization of co-care in practice.

METHODS: The current study is a parallel-group, simple randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 100 participants were randomized into a yoga group (YG) (n=50) and an attentional control group (CG) (n=50) by using an online randomizer. The YG received yoga practice, whereas the partially active CG received an educational program on digital hygiene.

The ways in which intervention studies are conventionally conducted and reported mean that there is often a shortage of information when an EBI is used in practice. The paper aims to invite the research community to consider ways to optimize not only the trustworthiness but also the research's usefulness in intervention studies. This is done by proposing a typology that provides some approaches to useful EBIs for intervention researchers. The approaches originate from different research fields and are summarized to highlight their potential benefits from a usefulness perspective. MAIN MESSAGE: The typology consists of research approaches to increase the usefulness of EBIs by improving the reporting of four features in intervention studies: (1) the interventions themselves, including core components and appropriate adaptations", (2) strategies to support-high-quality implementation of the interventions, (3) generalizations about the evidence in a variety of contexts," and (4) outcomes based on end users' preferences and knowledge. The research approaches fall into three levels: Description, Analysis, and Design. The first level, Description, outlines what types of information about the intervention and its implementation, context, and outcomes can be helpful for end users. Research approaches under analysis offers alternative ways of analyzing data, increasing the precision of information provided to end users. Approaches summarized under design involve more radical changes and far-reaching implications for how research can provide more useful information. These approaches partly flip the order of efficacy and effectiveness, focusing not on whether an intervention works in highly controlled and optimal circumstances, but first and foremost whether an intervention can be implemented and lead to anticipated outcomes in everyday practice. CONCLUSIONS: The research community, as well as the end users of research, are invited to consider ways to optimize research's usefulness as well as its trustworthiness. Many of the research approaches in the typology are not new, and their contributions to quality have been described for generations - but their contributions to useful knowledge need more attention."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12874-020-00992-2,*Delivery of Health Care","Humans,32460833,PMC7254642",,,,

Within this context, stakeholders can vary in their interests and perceptions of the ethical issues associated with this rapidly evolving technology in ways that can fail to identify and avert adverse outcomes. Identifying issues throughout the AI lifecycle in a systematic manner can facilitate better-informed ethical deliberation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed existing lifecycles from within the current literature for ethical issues of AI in healthcare to identify themes, which we relied upon to create a lifecycle that consolidates these themes into a more comprehensive lifecycle. We then considered the potential benefits and harms of AI through this lifecycle to identify ethical questions that can arise at each step and to identify where conflicts and errors could arise in ethical analysis. We illustrated the approach in 3 case studies that highlight how different ethical dilemmas arise at different points in the lifecycle.

Focusing on the UK, this paper asks how that can be achieved for medical AI research, that is, for research involving the training of AI on data from medical research databases. Public governance of medical AI research in the UK is generally achieved in three ways, namely, via lay representation on data access committees, through patient and public involvement groups, and by means of various deliberative democratic projects such as citizens' juries, citizen panels, citizen assemblies, etc.-what we collectively call """"citizen forums"""". As we will show, each of these public involvement initiatives have complementary strengths and weaknesses for providing oversight of medical AI research. As they are currently utilized, however, they are unable to realize the full potential of their complementarity due to insufficient information transfer across them. In order to synergistically build on their contributions, we offer here a multi-scale model integrating all three. In doing so we provide a unified public governance model for medical AI research, one that, we argue, could improve the trustworthiness of big data and AI related medical research in the future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40900-022-00357-7,"""",35598004,PMC9123617",,,,,,,,

In spite of this phenomena being known in the health informatics literature for decades, recent research shows how patient portals and electronic patients health records continue to reproduce health inequalities in Western societies. To better understand this discrepancy between scholarly awareness of such inequities and mainstream design, this study unravels the (conceptual) assumptions and practices of designers and others responsible for portal implementation in the Netherlands and how citizens living in vulnerable circumstances are included in this process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews (n = 24) and questionnaires (n = 14) with portal designers, health professionals, and policy advisors. RESULTS: In daily design practices, equity is seen as an """"end-of-the-pipeline"""" concern. Respondents identify health care professionals rather than patients as their main users. If patients are included in the design, this generally entails patients in privileged positions. The needs of citizens living in vulnerable circumstances are not prioritized in design processes. Developers legitimize their focus with reference to the innovation-theoretical approach of the Diffusion of Innovations. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although feminist scholars have developed important understandings of the exclusion of citizens living in vulnerable circumstances from portal design, other academic efforts have profoundly shaped daily practices of portal development. Diane Forsythe would likely have taken up this discrepancy as a challenge by finding ways to translate these insights into mainstream systems design."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1093/jamia/ocaa273,""Attitude of Health Personnel",Electronic Health Records,"*Health Records, Personal",Health Services Accessibility,*Healthcare Disparities,Humans,Interviews as Topic,Netherlands,

These adverse consequences following a loved one's admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) are also known as post-intensive care syndrome-family. Approaches such as family-centered care provide recommendations for improving the care of patients and families, but models for family caregiver follow-up are often lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a model for structuring and individualizing the follow-up of family caregivers of patients who are critically ill, starting from the patients' ICU admission to after their discharge or death. METHODS: The model was developed through a participatory co-design approach using a 2-phased iterative process. First, the preparation phase included a meeting with stakeholders (n=4) for organizational anchoring and planning, a literature search, and interviews with former family caregivers (n=8). In the subsequent development phase, the model was iteratively created through workshops with stakeholders (n=10) and user testing with former family caregivers (n=4) and experienced ICU nurses (n=11). RESULTS: The interviews revealed how being present with the patient and receiving adequate information and emotional care were highly important for family caregivers at an ICU. The literature search underlined the overwhelming and uncertain situation for the family caregivers and identified recommendations for follow-up. On the basis of these recommendations and findings from the interviews, workshops, and user testing, The Caregiver Pathway model was developed, encompassing 4 steps: within the first few days of the patient's ICU stay, the family caregivers will be offered to complete a digital assessment tool mapping their needs and challenges, followed by a conversation with an ICU nurse"," when the patient leaves the ICU, a card containing information and support will be handed out to the family caregivers"," shortly after the ICU stay, family caregivers will be offered a discharge conversation by phone, focusing on how they are doing and whether they have any questions or concerns"," and within 3 months after the ICU stay, an individual follow-up conversation will be offered. Family caregivers will be invited to talk about memories from the ICU and reflect upon the ICU stay, and they will also be able to talk about their current situation and receive information about relevant support. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how existing evidence and stakeholder input can be combined to create a model for family caregiver follow-up at an ICU. The Caregiver Pathway can help ICU nurses improve family caregiver follow-up and aid in promoting family-centered care, potentially also being transferrable to other types of family caregiver follow-up."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/46299,"""",37097744,PMC10170368",,,,,

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program on anxiety symptoms and other mental health outcomes among people vulnerable during COVID-19 owing to a pre-existing medical condition. METHODS: The SPIN-CHAT Trial was a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, partially nested, randomised, controlled trial (1:1 allocation to intervention or waitlist). Eligible participants with systemic sclerosis were recruited from the international SPIN COVID-19 Cohort. SPIN COVID-19 Cohort participants were eligible for the trial if they completed baseline measures and had at least mild anxiety symptoms, had not tested positive for COVID-19, and were not currently receiving mental health counselling. SPIN-CHAT is a 4-week (3 sessions per week) videoconference-based group intervention that provided education and practice with mental health coping strategies, and provided social support to reduce isolation. Groups included 6-10 participants. The primary outcome analysed in the intention-to-treat population was anxiety symptoms (PROMIS Anxiety 4a version 1.0) immediately post-intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04335279 and is complete. FINDINGS: Of participants who completed baseline measures between April 9, 2020, and April 27, 2020, 560 participants were eligible and 172 participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or waitlist (n=86). Mean age was 55·0 years (SD 11·4 years), 162 (94%) were women, and 136 (79%) identified as White. In intention-to-treat analyses, the intervention did not significantly reduce anxiety symptoms post-intervention (-1·57 points, 95% CI -3·59 to 0·45"," standardised mean difference [SMD] -0·22 points) but reduced symptoms 6 weeks later (-2·36 points, 95% CI -4·56 to -0·16"," SMD -0·31). Depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks post-intervention (-1·64 points, 95% CI -2·91 to -0·37", SMD -0·31)," no other secondary outcomes were significant. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: The intervention did not significantly improve anxiety symptoms or other mental health outcomes post-intervention. However, anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly lower 6 weeks later, potentially capturing the time it took for new skills and social support between intervention participants to affect mental health. Multi-faceted interventions such as SPIN-CHAT have potential to address mental health needs in vulnerable groups during COVID-19, yet uncertainty remains about effectiveness.

METHODS: We developed a web-based tiered informed consent tool called informed consent for clinical data and bio-sample use for research (iCONCUR) that honors granular patient preferences for use of electronic health record data in research. We piloted this tool in 4 outpatient clinics of an academic medical center. RESULTS: Of patients offered access to iCONCUR, 394 agreed to participate in this study, among whom 126 patients accessed the website to modify their records according to data category and data recipient. The majority consented to share most of their data and specimens with researchers. Willingness to share was greater among participants from an Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) clinic than those from internal medicine clinics. The number of items declined was higher for for-profit institution recipients. Overall, participants were most willing to share demographics and body measurements and least willing to share family history and financial data. Participants indicated that having granular choices for data sharing was appropriate, and that they liked being informed about who was using their data for what purposes, as well as about outcomes of the research.

This is crucial for reducing disease morbidity and mortality while meeting the growing demand for genetic counseling. We outline the design, development, and final concept and prototype of DNA-poli and discuss the challenges faced and how these were addressed. METHODS: We followed an approach based on the Design Thinking and Human-Centered Design methods, which entails four stages: 1) Discover/Define, 2) Design, 3) Develop, and 4) Deliver. Stakeholders were actively involved through interviews, focus groups, and sounding board consultations. Two inherited cardiac conditions (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy) served as the first use case. RESULTS: The DNA-poli prototype is a digital outpatient clinic for predictive counseling on inherited conditions and cascade testing. It facilitates both pre-test and post-test genetic counseling, including information provision on specific conditions and tests, decision support, collecting medical information from a counselee, and return of results.

This study assessed its performance within the scope of dentistry in: (a) tackling exam questions for dental students, (ii) providing guidelines for dental practitioners, and (iii) answering patients' frequently asked questions. We discuss the potential of clinical tutoring, common patient communication and impact on academia. METHODS: With the aim of assessing AI's performance in dental exams, Bing Chat was presented with 532 multiple-choice questions and awarded scores based on its answers. In evaluating guidelines for clinicians, a further set of 15 questions, each with 2 follow-up questions on clinical protocols, was presented to the AI. The answers were assessed by 4 reviewers using electronic visual analog scale. In evaluating answers to patients' frequently asked questions, another list of 15 common questions was included in the session, with respective outputs assessed. RESULTS: Bing Chat correctly answered 383 out of 532 multiple-choice questions in dental exam part, achieving a score of 71.99 %. As for outlining clinical protocols for practitioners, the overall assessment score was 81.05 %. In answering patients' frequently asked questions, Bing Chat achieved an overall mean score of 83.8 %.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between EM and digital screen time, uncorrected refractive error, intraocular pressure (IOP), and blood electrolyte levels. METHODS: Between February 2023 and June 2024, 103 eyes of 103 patients who applied to the ophthalmology outpatient clinic with complaints of eyelid twitching lasting for more than two weeks and 103 eyes of 103 healthy individuals as a control group were included in the study. All participants were asked to record their daily time spent with digital screens for two weeks. Cycloplegic refractive error, IOP, optic nerve head cup/disc (C/D) ratio, and blood calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Mean digital screen time was 4.84±1.74 hours in the control group and 6.88±2.01 hours in the EM group. It was found that digital screen time was significantly higher in the EM group compared to the control group (p<0.001). There was a strong positive correlation between the duration of eyelid twitching and the time spent in front of digital screens (p<0.001, r=0.670). There was no significant difference in cycloplegic refractive error, IOP, C/D ratio, and blood electrolyte levels between the two groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Prolonged digital screen time might play a role in the development of EM. On the other hand, no relationship was found between eyelid twitching and uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, or blood electrolyte levels."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.69249,"""",39282492,PMC11398718",,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the overall average glandular dose (AGD) of DBT is higher than that of DM. Comparing the DBT  SM and DM trial arm, we analyzed here the mean AGD and their determinants per breast density category and related them to the respective invasive cancer detection rates (iCDR). METHODS: TOSYMA screened 99,689 women aged 50 to 69 years. Compression force, resulting breast thickness, the calculated AGD obtained from each mammography device, and previously published iCDR were used for comparisons across breast density categories in the two trial arms. RESULTS: There were 196,622 exposures of 49,227 women (DBT  SM) and 197,037 exposures of 49,132 women (DM) available for analyses. Mean breast thicknesses declined from breast density category A (fatty) to D (extremely dense) in both trial arms. However, while the mean AGD in the DBT  SM arm declined concomitantly from category A (2.41 mGy) to D (1.89 mGy), it remained almost unchanged in the DM arm (1.46 and 1.51 mGy, respectively). In relative terms, the AGD elevation in the DBT  SM arm (64.4% (A), by 44.5% (B), 27.8% (C), and 26.0% (D)) was lowest in dense breasts where, however, the highest iCDR were observed. CONCLUSION: Women with dense breasts may specifically benefit from DBT  SM screening as high cancer detection is achieved with only moderate AGD elevations. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: TOSYMA suggests a favorable constellation for screening with digital breast tomosynthesis plus synthesized mammography (DBT  SM) in dense breasts when weighing average glandular dose elevation against raised invasive breast cancer detection rates. There is potential for density-, i.e., risk-adapted population-wide breast cancer screening with DBT  SM. KEY POINTS: Breast thickness declines with visually increasing density in digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Average glandular doses of DBT decrease with increasing density"," digital mammography shows lower and more constant values. With the smallest average glandular dose difference in dense breasts, DBT plus SM had the highest difference in invasive breast cancer detection rates."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00330-024-10847-9,Humans",Female,*Mammography/methods,Middle Aged,*Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging,Aged,*Breast Density,Peritoneal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*pathology

Computerized history taking (CHT) provides a systematic and automated method to obtain information necessary to calculate the HEAR score. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and diagnostic accuracy of CHT in calculating the HEAR score for predicting MACE. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective study including clinically stable adults presenting with chest pain at the emergency department (ED) of Danderyd University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden), in 2017-19. Participants entered their medical histories on touchscreen tablets using CHT software. The HEAR and HEART scores were calculated from CHT data. Thirty-day MACE and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) outcomes were retrieved, and the diagnostic accuracy was assessed. Logistic regression was used to determine the most predictive components of the HEAR score. Among 1000 patients, HEART and HEAR scores could be calculated from CHT data in 648 and 666 cases, respectively, with negative predictive values [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 0.98 (0.97-0.99) and 0.99 (0.96-1.00). Two patients with HEAR score <2 experienced a 30-day MACE. The age [odds ratio (OR) 2.75, 95% CI 1.62-4.66] and history (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.52-3.71) components of the HEAR score were most predictive of MACE. Acute coronary syndrome outcomes provided similar results. CONCLUSION: The HEAR score acquired by CHT identifies very-low-risk patients with chest pain in the ED, safely ruling out ACS and MACE. This highlights the value of computerized history taking by patients, which may reduce unnecessary tests and hospital admissions.

In doing this they are faced with many challenges. These parents have a wide range of unmet needs, especially for information, on different topics. It is sometimes hard for them to get the right information at the right moment, and to ask the right questions to physicians and other healthcare professionals. In order to develop a digital tool to help parents formulate questions and find information, we thought it would be crucial to work together in a process of co-creation with parents, researchers, IT-specialists and healthcare professionals. In close collaboration with them we developed a tool that aims to help parents ask questions, find information and take a more leading role in consultations with healthcare professionals, called the WWW-roadmap (WWW-wijzer in Dutch).In two groups of parents (one group with and one group without experience of using the tool), we will study the effects of using this tool, on consultations with physicians. We expect that using the tool will result in better empowerment, satisfaction and family-centred care. BACKGROUND: Parents of children with physical disabilities do much to support their child in daily life. In doing so, they are faced with many challenges. These parents have a wide range of unmet needs, especially for information, on various topics. Getting timely and reliable information is very difficult for parents, whereas being informed is a major requirement for the process of empowerment and shared decision-making. This paper describes the development of a digital tool to support parents in this process. During its development, working together with parents was crucial to address relevant topics and design a user-centred intervention. METHODS: In co-creation with parents, healthcare professionals, IT-professionals and researchers, a digital tool was developed, the 'WWW-roadmap' ['WWW-wijzer' in Dutch]. This digital tool aims to enable parents to explore their questions (What do I want to know?), help in their search for information (Where can I find the information I need), and refer to appropriate professionals (Who can assist me further?).During the process, we got extensive feedback from a parent panel consisting of parents of children with physical disabilities, enabling us to create the tool 'with' rather than 'for' them. This led to a user-friendly and problem-driven tool. DISCUSSION: The WWW-roadmap can function as a tool to help parents formulate their questions, search for information and thus prepare for consultations with healthcare professionals, and to facilitate parental empowerment and shared-decision making by parent and professional. Effects of using the WWW-roadmap on consultations with professionals will be studied in the future."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40900-017-0079-6,"""",29238612,PMC5724239",,,,,,,,

This shift has occurred in various work settings with an impact on spaces, approaches, applied techniques, and tools. This has resulted in the broad use of virtual tools in the health care sector to avoid physical encounters and in-person interactions that will likely outlast the COVID-19 pandemic. Developing effective virtual approaches requires the knowledge and skills of using digital technologies collaboratively combined with a deep understanding of the context or contexts in which these approaches may be used. The implementation of virtual health design methods, including web-based co-design, has increased to meet the realities of COVID-19 restrictions and is likely to outlast them. Adapting the use of co-design methodologies to a virtual configuration requires rethinking methods of collaboration and communication, adapting to virtual environments, and creating new methods of engagement and facilitation. With this viewpoint, we reviewed the current work on co-design (in person and web based) to propose techniques for the design, planning, and implementation of web-based co-design. We propose 7 considerations that may enable web-based co-design projects in the health care sector. The key considerations that affect the success of a web-based co-design approach should be considered in the process of planning, developing, and conducting web-based co-design sessions. These include facilitation, collaboration, accessibility and equity, communication, sensemaking, tangible tools and games, and web-based research ethics.

Moreover, it is frequently accompanied by bipolar disorder (BD) as well as borderline personality disorder (BPD). It is unclear whether these disorders share underlying pathomechanisms, given that all three are characterized by alterations in affective states, either long or short-term. BD is characterized by infrequent but intense mood shifts, while ADHD and BPD involve more dynamic emotional fluctuations. It is yet to be determined whether these disorders represent distinct phenomena or different points on a spectrum of affective dysregulation. METHODS: This study seeks to distinguish the emotional dysregulation of BPD, ADHD, and BD by using digital phenotyping, a measurement burst electronic-diary method with different sampling rates, and accelerometry to measure participants' activity. Our study will include 480 participants aged 14 to 50 (120 each from BPD, ADHD, BD, and healthy control groups) from five European sites. Participants' smartphones will provide continuous data on their digital phenotypes, i.e., by indicators of physical activity and communication, for one year, along with daily evening ratings of mood and sleep. Moreover, five intensive measurement periods of five days each, called measurement bursts, will occur throughout the year, with electronic diaries asking participants to report on mood, self-esteem, impulsivity, life events, social interactions, and dysfunctional behaviors ten times a day. Moreover, participants will wear activity sensors during the five measurement bursts. Statistical analysis aims to identify whether affective dysregulation aspects share or differ across disorders. Specifically, data analysis aims to investigate the differences in parameters of affect fluctuation such as attractor strength and variability between disorders and to test the association of genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders and resilience factors with critical parameters of affect modulation. DISCUSSION: The results of this study offer the potential to link patients' external exposures with their affective state, reduce misdiagnosis, and determine the best timing for therapeutic interventions. Potential limitations of the study include insufficient recruitment of patients and drop-outs due to various protocol violations.

Telemonitoring technology has the potential to improve self-care management with the support of healthcare professionals for people with chronic diseases living at home. Patient safety threats related to telemonitoring and how they may affect patients' and healthcare professionals' sense of security need attention. This study aimed to explore patients' and healthcare professionals' experiences of safety and sense of security when using telemonitoring of chronic conditions at home. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty patients and nine healthcare professionals (nurses and physicians), recruited from four primary healthcare centers and one medical department in a region in southern Sweden using telemonitoring service for chronic conditions in home healthcare. RESULTS: The main theme was that experiences of safety and a sense of security were intertwined and relied on patients´ and healthcare professionals´ mutual engagement in telemonitoring and managing symptoms together. Telemonitoring was perceived to increase symptom awareness and promote early detection of deterioration promoting patient safety. A sense of security emerged through having someone keeping track of symptoms and comprised aspects of availability, shared responsibility, technical confidence, and empowering patients in self-management. The meeting with technology changed healthcare professionals' work processes, and patients' daily routines, creating patient safety risks if combined with low health- and digital literacy and a naïve reliance on technology. Empowering patients' self-management ability and improving shared understanding of the patient's health status and symptom management were prerequisites for safe care and the patient´s sense of security. CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring chronic conditions in the homecare context can promote a sense of security when care is co-created in a mutual understanding and responsibility. Attentiveness to the patient's health literacy, symptom management, and health-related safety behavior when using eHealth technology may enlighten and mitigate latent patient safety risks. A systems approach indicates that patient safety risks related to telemonitoring are not only associated with the patient's and healthcare professionals functioning and behavior or the human-technology interaction. Mitigating patient safety risks are likely also dependent on the complex management of home health and social care service."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-023-09428-1,Humans",*Patient Safety,Chronic Disease,Delivery of Health Care,*Telemedicine,Patients,"Qualitative Research,37340472,PMC10283165",,

In response to the ever-increasing threats, health care organizations (HOs) are enhancing the technical measures with the use of cybersecurity controls and other advanced solutions for further protection. Despite the need for technical controls, humans are evidently the weakest link in the cybersecurity posture of HOs. This suggests that addressing the human aspects of cybersecurity is a key step toward managing cyber-physical risks. In practice, HOs are required to apply general cybersecurity and data privacy guidelines that focus on human factors. However, there is limited literature on the methodologies and procedures that can assist in successfully mapping these guidelines to specific controls (interventions), including awareness activities and training programs, with a measurable impact on personnel. To this end, tools and structured methodologies for assisting higher management in selecting the minimum number of required controls that will be most effective on the health care workforce are highly desirable. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to introduce a cyber hygiene (CH) methodology that uses a unique survey-based risk assessment approach for raising the cybersecurity and data privacy awareness of different employee groups in HOs. The main objective was to identify the most effective strategy for managing cybersecurity and data privacy risks and recommend targeted human-centric controls that are tailored to organization-specific needs. METHODS: The CH methodology relied on a cross-sectional, exploratory survey study followed by a proposed risk-based survey data analysis approach. First, survey data were collected from 4 different employee groups across 3 European HOs, covering 7 categories of cybersecurity and data privacy risks. Next, survey data were transcribed and fitted into a proposed risk-based approach matrix that translated risk levels to strategies for managing the risks. RESULTS: A list of human-centric controls and implementation levels was created. These controls were associated with risk categories, mapped to risk strategies for managing the risks related to all employee groups. Our mapping empowered the computation and subsequent recommendation of subsets of human-centric controls to implement the identified strategy for managing the overall risk of the HOs. An indicative example demonstrated the application of the CH methodology in a simple scenario. Finally, by applying the CH methodology in the health care sector, we obtained results in the form of risk markings", identified strategies to manage the risks," and recommended controls for each of the 3 HOs, each employee group, and each risk category. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CH methodology improves the CH perception and behavior of personnel in the health care sector and provides risk strategies together with a list of recommended human-centric controls for managing a wide range of cybersecurity and data privacy risks related to health care employees."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/41294,Humans",*Privacy,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Delivery of Health Care,Computer Security,"Organizations,37498644,PMC10415935",

The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) receives applications from patients whose symptoms and signs have been intractable to diagnosis"," however, many UDN applicants are affected primarily by subjective symptoms such as pain and fatigue. We sought to characterize presenting symptoms, referral sources, and demographic factors of applicants to the UDN to identify factors that may determine application outcome and potentially differentiate between those with undiagnosed diseases (with more objective findings) and those who are less likely to have an undiagnosed disease (more subjective symptoms). METHODS: We used a systematic retrospective review of 151 consecutive Not Accepted and 50 randomly selected Accepted UDN applications. The primary outcome was whether an applicant was Accepted, or Not Accepted, and, if accepted, whether or not a diagnosis was made. Objective and subjective symptoms and information on prior specialty consultations were collected from provider referral letters. Demographic data and decision data on network acceptance were gathered from the UDN online portal. RESULTS: Fewer objective findings and more subjective symptoms were found in the Not Accepted applications. Not Accepted referrals also were from older individuals, reported a shorter period of illness, and were referred to the UDN by their primary care physicians. All of these differences reached statistical significance in comparison with Accepted applications. The frequency of subspecialty consults for diagnostic purposes prior to UDN application was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The preponderance of subjective and lack of objective findings in the Not Accepted applications distinguish these from applicants that are accepted for evaluation and diagnostic efforts through the UDN. Not Accepted applicants are referred primarily by their primary care providers after multiple specialist consultations fail to yield answers. Distinguishing between patients with undiagnosed diseases with objective findings and those with primarily subjective findings can delineate patients who would benefit from further diagnostic processes from those who may have functional disorders and need alternative pathways for management of their symptoms.

It plays a pivotal role in achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), with the ultimate goal of ensuring health equity for all. A fundamental strategy to bolster efficiency involves pinpointing the underlying causes of inefficiency within the healthcare system through empirical research. This study aimed to determine and prioritize the causes of inefficiency in Iran's health system. METHODS: This mixed-method study comprised three phases. The initial phase involved identifying the causes of inefficiency through a comprehensive literature review of relevant studies published between January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2021. The causes were then aligned and prioritized using criteria derived from the literature and expert opinion. Finally, the identified causes were ranked based on their significance using Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). RESULTS: From an initial pool of 307 causes of inefficiency, they were reduced to 121 causes in the first round of screening which were categorized into 13 thematic topics. The second screening process further narrowed the list to 48 causes. Among these, the leading causes of inefficiency included the inadequate supply and unequal distribution of hospital beds, the overuse of health services, and the mismanagement of the health workforce. In contrast, the use of traditional treatment methods was determined to be the least significant factor contributing to inefficiency. CONCLUSION: This study identified key inefficiencies in Iran's health system, such as resource misallocation, overuse of services, and workforce mismanagement. Addressing these issues is essential for optimizing resource utilization, enhancing service delivery, and achieving UHC. The findings suggest that policymakers should prioritize reforms in hospital bed distribution, implement strategies to reduce unnecessary health service use, and strengthen human resource management. Additionally, targeted policies that focus on decentralizing healthcare decision-making and enhancing primary care could significantly improve system-wide efficiency. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and explore the role of digital health solutions in mitigating identified inefficiencies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12962-024-00593-6,"""",39533362,PMC11558905",,,,,,,,"Workload"",28697744,PMC5504987"

We developed a web-based questionnaire that was administered to Italian physicians from 1 May to 15 June 2022. The questionnaire was distributed as a link to Google Forms via social networks/instant messaging applications to groups of graduated and qualified physicians. A total of 180 physicians answered the questionnaire (with an age range from 25 to 68 years old). Physicians belonging to the medical area of expertise appear to more frequently use new technologies in comparison to other specialties. The vast majority believe that it is appropriate to use Telemedicine for monitoring and follow-up but not for evaluating a new patient. Concerns about changes in the physician-patient relationship, informed consent, digital barrier, and privacy and data protection also emerged.

This poses challenges under the current framework of laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines applicable to health care in South Africa. The article outlines these challenges and sets out guiding principles for a normative framework to regulate the use of AI in health care. The article examines three key areas for legal reform in relation to AI in health care. First, it proposes that the regulatory framework for the oversight of software as a medical device needs to be updated to develop frameworks for adequately regulating the use of such new technologies. Secondly, it argues that the present HPCSA guidelines for health care practitioners in South Africa adopt an unduly restrictive approach centred in the outmoded semantics of telemedicine. This may discourage technological innovation that could improve access to health care for all, and as such the guidelines are inconsistent with the national digital health strategy. Thirdly, it examines the common law principles of fault-based liability for medical negligence, which could prove inadequate to provide patients and users of new technologies with redress for harm where fault cannot clearly be attributed to the healthcare practitioner. It argues that consideration should be given to developing a statutory scheme for strict liability, together with mandatory insurance, and appropriate reform of product liability pertaining to technology developers and manufacturers.

Using the implementation of a digital intervention within routine National Health Service (NHS) practice, we provide an example of how to develop a theoretically based implementation plan and how to report it transparently. In doing so we also highlight some of the challenges to implementation in routine healthcare. METHODS: The implemented intervention was HeLP-Diabetes, a digital self-management programme for people with Type 2 Diabetes, which was effective in improving diabetes control. The target setting for the implementation was an inner city London Clinical Commissioning Group in the NHS comprised of 34 general practices. HeLP-Diabetes was designed to be offered to patients as part of routine diabetes care across England. Evidence synthesis, engagement of local stakeholders, a theory of implementation (Normalization Process Theory), feedback, qualitative interviews and usage data were used to develop an implementation plan. RESULTS: A new implementation plan was developed to implement HeLP-Diabetes within routine practice. Individual component strategies were selected and developed informed by Normalization Process Theory. These strategies included: engagement of local opinion leaders, provision of educational materials, educational visits, educational meetings, audit and feedback and reminders. Additional strategies were introduced iteratively to address barriers that arose during the implementation. Barriers largely related to difficulties in allocating resources to implement the intervention within routine care. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a worked example of implementing a digital health intervention. The learning from this work can inform others undertaking the work of planning and executing implementation activities in routine healthcare. Of particular importance is: the selection of appropriate theory to guide the implementation process and selection of strategies", ensuring that enough attention is paid to planning implementation," and a flexible approach that allows response to emerging barriers."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-3615-7,""Delivery of Health Care/*organization & administration","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*therapy",England,Evidence-Based Practice,*Health Plan Implementation,Humans,

This study tests whether intravascular magnetic resonance imaging (IVMRI) measures of relaxation times (T(1), T(2)) and proton density (PD) in a clinical 3 Tesla scanner could characterize vessel disease, and evaluates a practical strategy for accelerated quantification. METHODS: IVMRI was performed in fresh human artery segments and swine vessels in vivo, using fast multi-parametric sequences, 1-2 mm diameter loopless antennae and 200-300 µm resolution. T(1), T(2) and PD data were used to train a machine learning classifier (support vector machine, SVM) to automatically classify normal vessel, and early or advanced disease, using histology for validation. Disease identification using the SVM was tested with receiver operating characteristic curves. To expedite acquisition of T(1), T(2) and PD data for vessel characterization, the linear algebraic method ('SLAM') was modified to accommodate the antenna's highly-nonuniform sensitivity, and used to provide average T(1), T(2) and PD measurements from compartments of normal and pathological tissue segmented from high-resolution images at acceleration factors of R = 18-fold. The results were validated using compartment-average measures derived from the high-resolution scans. RESULTS: The SVM accurately classified ~80% of samples into the three disease classes. The 'area-under-the-curve' was 0.96 for detecting disease in 248 samples, with T(1) providing the best discrimination. SLAM T(1), T(2) and PD measures for R = 10 were indistinguishable from the true means of segmented tissue compartments. CONCLUSION: High-resolution IVMRI measures of T(1), T(2) and PD with a trained SVM can automatically classify normal, early and advanced atherosclerosis with high sensitivity and specificity.

Despite its importance, this process currently lacks automation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate implant size prediction. METHODS: A total of 13,281 (2938 anteroposterior, 10,343 lateral) knee radiographs obtained from the authors' institute were utilized for model training, with 2302 (1034 anteroposterior, 1268 lateral) images set apart for validation and testing. The templating AI model integrates a pipeline composed of multiple steps for automated implant size estimation. To predict implant size, anterioposterior (AP) and lateral radiograph predictions were merged, selecting the smaller of the predicted sizes to prevent implant overhang. The model's size predictions were validated with 81 real TKA data set apart from the training data, and its accuracy was compared to that of manual templating by an orthopedic specialist. Predictions matching the actual implanted sizes were labeled """"exact"""" and those within one size, """"accurate.""""

These patients require frequent and long-term follow-up and repeated treatments, resulting in increased pressure on clinical workloads. Due to limited clinic capacity, many National Health Service (NHS) clinics are failing to maintain recommended follow-up intervals for patients receiving care. As such, clear and robust, long term retinal service models are required to assess and respond to the needs of local populations, both currently and in the future. METHODS: A discrete event simulation (DES) tool was developed to facilitate the improvement of retinal services by identifying efficiencies and cost savings within the pathway of care. For a mid-size hospital in England serving a population of over 500,000, we used 36 months of patient level data in conjunction with statistical forecasting and simulation to predict the impact of making changes within the service. RESULTS: A simulation of increased demand and a potential solution of the 'Treat and Extend' (T&E) regimen which is reported to result in better outcomes, in combination with virtual clinics which improve quality, effectiveness and productivity and thus increase capacity is presented. Without the virtual clinic, where T&E is implemented along with the current service, we notice a sharp increase in the number of follow-ups, number of Anti-VEGF injections, and utilisation of resources. In the case of combining T&E with virtual clinics, there is a negligible (almost 0%) impact on utilisation of resources. CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of services to accommodate increasing number of patients seen and treated in retinal services is feasible with service re-organisation. It is inevitable that some form of initial investment is required to implement service expansion through T&E and virtual clinics. However, modelling with DES indicates that such investment is outweighed by cost reductions in the long term as more patients receive optimal treatment and retain vision with better outcomes. The model also shows that the service will experience an average of 10% increase in surplus capacity."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-3560-5,Ambulatory Care Facilities/standards/statistics & numerical data",Bevacizumab,Computer Simulation,Computer Systems,Cost Savings,Data Accuracy,Delivery of Health Care/standards,England,

Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are one of the effective interventions for malaria control and prevention. In response to funding constraints in the Global Fund Grant Cycle 7, Nigeria's National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) aimed to develop an approach that maximizes the impact of limited malaria interventions by focusing on areas with the greatest need. We developed an urban LLINs distribution framework and a novel strategy, which was piloted in Ilorin, the capital of Kwara State. METHODS: A participatory action research approach, combined with abductive inquiry, was employed to co-design a framework for guiding bed net distribution. The final framework consisted of three phases: planning, data review and co-decision-making, and implementation. During the framework's operationalization, malaria risk scores were computed at the ward level using four key variables, including malaria case data and environmental factors, and subsequently mapped. A multistakeholder dialogue facilitated the selection of the final malaria risk maps. Additionally, data from an ongoing study were analyzed to determine whether local definitions of formal, informal, and slum settlements could inform community-level stratification of malaria risk in cities. RESULTS: Akanbi 4, a ward located in Ilorin South and Are 2, a ward in Ilorin East consistently had lower risk scores, a finding corroborated during the multistakeholder dialogue. A map combining malaria test positivity rates among children under five and the proportion of poor settlements was identified as the most accurate depiction of ward-level malaria risk. Malaria prevalence varied significantly across the categories of formal, informal, and slum settlements, resulting in specific definitions developed for Ilorin. Thirteen communities classified as formal settlements in Are 2 were de-prioritized during the bed net distribution campaign. CONCLUSIONS: The framework shows promise in facilitating evidence-based decision-making under resource constraints. The findings highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement in evaluating data outputs, particularly in settings with limited and uncertain data. Enhancing surveillance systems is crucial for a more comprehensive approach to intervention tailoring, in alignment with WHO's recommendations."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s44263-025-00126-0,"""",39910663,PMC11800435",,,,,,,,

At the same time, these methods and tools introduce a dependence on technology, often resulting in a need for technical skills and expertise. Researchers from various disciplines engage in empirical bioethics research, and software development and similar skills are not usually part of their background. Therefore, researchers often depend on technical experts to develop and apply digital methods, which can create a bottleneck and hinder the broad use of digital methods in empirical bioethics research. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a research platform that would offer researchers the means to better leverage implemented digital methods, and that would simplify the process of developing new methods. METHODS: This study used a mixed methods approach to design and develop a research platform prototype. I combined established methods from user-centered design, rapid prototyping, and agile software development to iteratively develop the platform prototype. In collaboration with two other researchers, I tested and extended the platform prototype in situ by carrying out a study using the prototype. RESULTS: The resulting research platform prototype provides three digital methods, which are composed of functional components. This modular concept allows researchers to use existing methods for their own experiments and combine implemented components into new methods. CONCLUSIONS: The platform prototype illustrates the potential of the modular concept and empowers researchers without advanced technical skills to carry out experiments using digital methods and develop new methods.

Dementia researchers think that these devices could potentially be used as part of future research projects, for example to help spot changes in daily activity that may signal the early symptoms of dementia. We asked a range of older people, including people living with dementia and their carers, to participate in interactive discussions about how future participants might find using these devices as part of research projects. We also invited volunteers to borrow a range of devices to test at home, giving them further insights. Discussions revealed that people were generally supportive of this type of research, provided they gave informed consent and that devices were discreet, comfortable and easy to use. They also valued technical support and regular feedback on study progress to encourage ongoing participation. These findings were used to develop a pool of devices for researchers, with computer software and written guidance to help plan, design and support studies. Our work shows that when given the right opportunities, people who are affected by dementia can provide valuable insights that can enhance the design, delivery and quality of future research. ABSTRACT: Background Increasingly, researchers are recognising the potential for connected health devices, including smartphones and smartwatches, to generate high resolution data about patterns of daily activity and health outcomes. One aim of the Dementias Platform UK (DPUK) project is to provide researchers with a secure means to collect, collate and link data generated by such devices, thereby accelerating this type of research in the field of dementia. We aimed to involve members of the public in discussions about the acceptability and feasibility of different devices and research designs to inform the development of a device pool, software platform and written guidance to support future studies. Methods Over 30 people attended a series of interactive workshops, drop-in sessions and meetings in Greater Manchester. This included people living with dementia and cognitive impairments, carers and people without memory problems. Discussions were tailored to suit different audiences and focused on the feasibility and acceptability of a range of different wearable devices and research designs. We also invited volunteers to borrow a device to test at home, enabling further insights from hands-on interactions with devices. Results Discussions revealed that people were supportive of connected health dementia research in principle, provided they gave informed consent and that devices were discreet, comfortable and easy to use. Moreover, they recommended technical support and regular feedback on study progress to encourage ongoing participation. Conclusion By using a range of discussion-based and practical activities, we found it was feasible to involve people affected by dementia and use their insights to shape the development of a software platform and device pool to support future connected health dementia research. We recommend that researchers planning such studies in future pay adequate attention to designing suitable participant information, technical support and mechanisms of providing study progress updates to support sustained engagement from participants."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40900-017-0063-1,"""",29062537,PMC5611650",,,,,,,,

A national steering group led on producing information videos and a website for patients, carers and healthcare professionals, forming part of a quality improvement program. Videos were planned, scripted and produced with healthcare professionals and patient/carer representatives, and were completed with both English and Welsh language versions. The TalkCPR videos encourage and promote open discussion about Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and DNACPR in palliative care situations. METHODS: We worked with patient/carer groups to evaluate whether video resources to convey the salient facts involved in CPR and DNACPR decisions for people with palliative and life-limiting illness were acceptable or not. We conducted a mixed-method design service review in five phases to evaluate whether this technological resource could help. After creating video and website materials, they were evaluated by doctors, nurses and a patient/carer group. We also sent out one lightweight TalkCPR video media pad to each practice in Wales. These rechargeable electronic video media pads had communication videos pre-loaded for easy viewing, especially in areas with poor roaming data coverage. RESULTS: Videos were demonstrably acceptable to both patient and carer groups, and improved healthcare professional confidence and understanding. Videos went live on the TalkCPR website, in all Welsh Health Boards and on Youtube, and are now used in routine practice throughout Wales. CONCLUSION: This is the first time that DNACPR information videos are aimed directly at palliative care patients and carers, to explore this sensitive subject with them, and to encourage them to approach their doctor or nurse about it. The website, app and video media pads were developed by patients, the Digital Legacy Association, Welsh NHS IT services, Welsh Government, the Bevan Commission and the Dying Matters Charity in Wales 'Byw Nawr'.

However, no mature, non-destructive method currently exists in clinical dentistry to quickly, accurately, and comprehensively assess the integrity and thickness of enamel chair-side. This study aims to develop a deep learning work, 2.5D Attention U-Net, trained on small sample datasets, for the automatical, efficient, and accurate segmentation of enamel across all teeth in clinical settings. METHODS: We propose a fully automated computer-aided enamel segmentation model based on an instance segmentation network, 2.5D Attention U-Net. After data annotation and augmentation, the model is trained using manually annotated segmented enamel data, and its performance is evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient metrics. A satisfactory image segmentation model is applied to generate a 3D enamel model for each tooth and to calculate the thickness value of individual enclosed 3D enamel meshes using a normal ray-tracing directional method. RESULTS: The model achieves the Dice score on the enamel segmentation task of 96.6%. This study provides an intuitive visualization of irregular enamel morphology and a quantitative analysis of three-dimensional enamel thickness variations. The results indicate that enamel is thickest at the incisal edges of anterior teeth and the cusps of posterior teeth, thinning towards the roots. For posterior teeth, the enamel is thinnest at the central fossae area, with mandibular molars having thicker enamel in the central fossae compared to maxillary molars. The average enamel thickness of maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars is greater than that of mandibular incisors, while the opposite is true for molars. Although there are individual variations in enamel thickness, the average enamel thickness graduallly increases from the incisors to the molars among all teeth within the same quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces an automatic, efficient, and accurate 2.5D Attention U-Net system to enhance precise and efficient chair-side diagnosis and treatment of enamel-related diseases in clinical settings, marking a significant advancement in automated diagnostics for enamel-related conditions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12903-024-05385-1,""Humans",*Deep Learning,"*Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods",*Dental Enamel/diagnostic imaging/anatomy & histology,"Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods"",39856656,PMC11761753",,,,

The aim of this study was to explore patient perspectives on patient-centredness in precision medicine for RA treatment. DESIGN: Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore patients' perspectives on a new personalised approach to RA treatment. The interview guide was developed together with patient research partners and health care professionals. SETTING: An invitation to the interviews was sent through a mobile application. The interviews were one-on-one, using an interview guide with open-ended questions. Interviews were conducted digitally (October 2020-February 2021) via Zoom or telephone, depending on each participant's preferences. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with RA (N=12) were purposively recruited. Patients were eligible if they had an RA diagnosis, were aged 18-80 years, and understood and expressed themselves in Swedish. Participants and researchers did not know each other prior to the interviews. RESULTS: Participants expressed desires and needs for patients to have an active role in precision medicine by making shared treatment decisions together with a healthcare professional. In order for that to work, patients need information on potential treatment options, an ability to express their preferences, an individual treatment plan and identification of personal treatment goals. Patients also identified two requirements of healthcare professional in precision medicine: a safe environment to express personal matters and two-way communication with healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Communication between patients and healthcare professionals needs to be more focused on patients' individual treatment preferences and expressed needs, in order to increase patient-centredness in treatment decisions, so shared decision-making can become a reality. More research is needed to design multifaceted implementation strategies to support patients and healthcare professionals to increase patient-centredness throughout treatment personalisation."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058303,""*Arthritis, Rheumatoid/therapy",Decision Making,Humans,*Patient Preference,Precision Medicine,"Qualitative Research"",35649604,PMC9161063",,,

Maze Out is a digital game co-produced by clinicians, patients with eating disorders (EDs), an art director with lived experience in EDs, and a game-developing company. Maze Out is based on everyday challenges when suffering from EDs and is currently being evaluated as a supplement tool in EDs treatment. Several studies on co-producing mental health interventions focus on design and effectiveness, but the experiences of those involved in the co-production process remain unexplored. An in-depth exploration of stakeholders' experiences offers valuable insights into the impact of co-production on different groups and generates crucial knowledge for successful implementation. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated and explored the co-production process and the meaning that EDs patients, clinicians, and game designers attributed to their participation in the co-production of Maze Out. The objectives were to determine (1) how stakeholders experienced their collaboration in the co-production of Maze Out."," and (2) to what extent the stakeholders involved in developing Maze Out followed Cahn's principles of equality, diversity, accessibility, and reciprocity. METHODS: Five stakeholders (two patients, two clinicians, and a game designer) who participated in the co-production completed semi-structured interviews. Two patients and one clinician's diaries supplemented the interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. RESULTS: The results of this study highlight the importance of building a common language between clinicians, patients, and other professionals involved in developing new forms of treatment and interventions. A recommendation for researchers and clinicians to implement co-production in the future is that Cahn's principles: equality, reciprocity, accessibility, and diversity, serve as a strong foundation for successful co-production. In this study, three and partially one of the four Cahn's principles about co-production were identified: equality, reciprocity, and accessibility. When applied in an ED context, these principles provided stakeholders with valuable insights, enriching practice-based knowledge, using the knowledge applicable to clinical practice, and demonstrating their crucial role in fostering effective co-production processes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40337-024-01136-3,"""",39543730,PMC11566361",,,,,,,

Improving care in these areas is complex, with multiple stakeholders and organizations. Appropriate strategies to develop capability for continuing organizational improvement and learning (COIL) are needed. The purpose of our study was to develop and pilot-test a flexible, multilevel approach for COIL capability building and to identify what it takes to achieve changes in key actors' approaches to COIL. The approach, named """"Sustainable Improvement and Development through Strategic and Systematic Approaches"""" (SIDSSA), was applied through an action-research and action-learning intervention. METHODS: The SIDSSA approach was tested in a regional research and development (R&D) unit, and in two municipalities handling care of the elderly and people with functional impairments. Our approach included a multilevel strategy, development loops of five flexible phases, and an action-learning loop. The approach was designed to support systems understanding, strategic focus, methodological practices, and change process knowledge - all of which required double-loop learning. Multiple qualitative methods, i.e., repeated interviews, process diaries, and documents, provided data for conventional content analyses. RESULTS: The new approach was successfully tested on all cases and adopted and sustained by the R&D unit. Participants reported new insights and skills. The development loop facilitated a sense of coherence and control during uncertainty, improved planning and problem analysis, enhanced mapping of context and conditions, and supported problem-solving at both the individual and unit levels. The systems-level view and structured approach helped participants to explain, motivate, and implement change initiatives, especially after working more systematically with mapping, analyses, and goal setting. CONCLUSIONS: An easily understood and generalizable model internalized by key organizational actors is an important step before more complex development models can be implemented. SIDSSA facilitated individual and group learning through action-learning and supported systems-level views and structured approaches across multiple organizational levels. Active involvement of diverse organizational functions and levels in the learning process was facilitated. However, the time frame was too short to fully test all aspects of the approach, specifically in reaching beyond the involved managers to front-line staff and patients."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-018-3129-3,Aged",Delivery of Health Care/*organization & administration,Persons with Disabilities,Health Services Research,Health Services for the Aged/*organization & administration,Humans,Learning,Pilot Projects,

Recent studies suggested the significance of such websites as a data source for patients to choose doctors for healthcare providers to learn and improve from patient feedback and to foster a culture of trust and transparency between patients and healthcare providers. However, as compared to other medical specialties, studies of online patient reviews that focus on dentists in the United States remain absent. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to understand to what extent online patient reviews can provide performance feedbacks that reflect dental care quality and patient experience. METHODS: Using mixed informatics methods incorporating statistics, natural language processing, and domain expert evaluation, we analyzed the online patient reviews of 204,751 dentists extracted from HealthGrades with two specific aims. First, we examined the associations between patient ratings and a variety of dentist characteristics. Second, we identified topics from patient reviews that can be mapped to the national assessment of dental patient experience measured by the Patient Experience Measures from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Dental Plan Survey. RESULTS: Higher ratings were associated with female dentists (t(71881)=2.45, P<.01, g=0.01), dentists at a younger age (F(7, 107128)=246.97, P<.001, g=0.11), and those whose patients experienced a short wait time (F(4, 150055)=10417.77, P<0.001, g=0.18). We also identified several topics that corresponded to CAHPS measures, including discomfort (eg, painful/painless root canal or deep cleaning), and ethics (eg, high-pressure sales, and unnecessary dental work).

The aim of this research was to co-design a novel chatbot capable of delivering a single session intervention for adults on the waitlist for eating disorder treatment across the diagnostic spectrum and ascertain its preliminary acceptability and feasibility. METHODS: A Double Diamond co-design approach was employed which included four phases: discover, define, develop, and deliver.

Learning analytics (the use of data science methods to generate actionable educational insights) have great potential to impact learning practices during the shift to digital. In particular, they can help fill a critical information gap for students created by an absence of classroom-based cues and the need for increased self-regulation in the online environment, However the adoption of learning analytics in effective, ethical and responsible ways is non-trivial. Ifenthaler and Schumacher (2016) present important findings about students' perceptions of learning analytics' usefulness and privacy, signaling the need for a student-centered paradigm, but stop short of addressing its implications for the creation and adoption of learning analytics tools.

METHODS: This study analyzed death records from January 2017 to June 2022, sourced from Malaysia's Health Informatics Centre, coded into ICD-10. Data anonymization adhered to ethical standards, with 387,650 death registrations included after quality checks. The dataset, limited to three-digit ICD-10 codes, underwent cleaning and an 80:20 training-testing split. Preprocessing involved HTML tag removal and tokenization. ML approaches, including BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), Gzip? (K-Nearest Neighbors), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), TensorFlow, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Naive Bayes, were evaluated for automated ICD-10 coding. Models were fine-tuned and assessed across accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, specificity, and precision-recall curves using Amazon SageMaker (Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA). Sensitivity analysis addressed unbalanced data scenarios, enhancing model robustness. RESULTS: In assessing ICD-10 coding with ML, Gzip? had the longest training time at 10 hours, with BERT leading in memory use. BERT performed best for the F1-score (0.71) and accuracy (0.82), closely followed by Gzip?. TensorFlow excelled in recall, whereas SVM had the highest specificity but lower overall performance. XGBoost was notably less effective across metrics. Precision-recall analysis showed Gzip?'s superiority. On an unbalanced dataset, BERT and Gzip? demonstrated consistent accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that BERT and Gzip? optimize ICD-10 coding, balancing efficiency, resource use, and accuracy. BERT excels in precision with higher memory demands, while Gzip? offers robust accuracy and recall. This suggests significant potential for improving healthcare analytics and decision-making through advanced ML models."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.77342,"""",39944445,PMC11813644",,,,,,,,

METHODS: The VPM score was based on the results of 10 videos showing increasing difficulty in performing specific functional tasks. Patients were requested to choose the video that best reflected their own level of function. Clinical presentation and radiological findings were documented. Self-report measures were the lower extremity functional score (LEFS) and pain scale. The performance-based measures were the 30- second Chair Stand Test (CST) and the 40-meter fast paced walk test (40 m FPWT) test. RESULTS: Data of 100 patients, 64 (64%) females, mean age: 67 ±10 were examined. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient that examined internal consistency of the VPM total score was 0.88. Factor analysis showed two distinct domains. Moderate correlations were observed between the VPM total score and the LEFS, pain score, and 40 m FPWT (r > 0.50). The VPM and the LEFS were able to differentiate between candidates and non-candidates for hip arthroplasty and between those with and without assistive walking devices. There was no statistically significant difference between the overall accuracy of the VPM and LEFS in the area under the curve value (0.72 vs. 0.71) with respect to candidacy for surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews of the designers, clinician-users, affiliated administrators, and patients, and inductive qualitative analysis of transcribed interviews using modified grounded theory. RESULTS: Seventeen stakeholders were interviewed. Five """"values-collisions""""-where stakeholders disagreed about decisions with ethical implications-were identified: (1) end-of-life workflow and how model output is introduced", (2) which stakeholders receive predictions, (3) benefit-harm trade-offs, (4) whether the ML design team has a fiduciary relationship to patients and clinicians," and, (5) how and if to protect early deployment research from external pressures, like news scrutiny, before research is completed. DISCUSSION: From these findings, the ML design team prioritized: (1) alternative workflow implementation strategies"," (2) clarification that prediction was only evaluated for ACP need, not other mortality-related ends"," and (3) shielding research from scrutiny until endpoint driven studies were completed. CONCLUSION: In this case study, our ethical analysis of this ML-HCA for ACP was able to identify multiple sites of intrastakeholder disagreement that mark areas of ethical and value tension.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PRECOG will be developed following published guidance from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) network and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will be meetings of a working group every other week with rotating external advisors (active until stage 5). Stage 2 will comprise a systematic review of literature on counterfactual prediction modelling for biomedical sciences (registered in Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). In stage 3, a computer-based, real-time Delphi survey will be performed to consolidate the PRECOG checklist, involving experts in causal inference, epidemiology, statistics, machine learning, informatics and protocols/standards. Stage 4 will involve the write-up of the PRECOG guideline based on the results from the prior stages. Stage 5 will seek the peer-reviewed publication of the guideline, the scoping/systematic review and dissemination.

Through tracing the creative work of patients, publics, scientists, clinicians, artists, film-makers, and campaigning groups this chapter explores how ?patient voices? are being rearticulated and represented around animal research. The figure of ?the patient? has been a powerful actor in arguments around animal research, mostly ?spoken for? by formal organisations, especially in publicity material making ethical justifications for the need and funding of medical research. Here, patient voices make corporeal needs legible, gather expectations and resources, and provide the horizon for embodying future hopes. However, the accessibility of digital media, alongside local institutional experiments in openness, is creating alternative spaces for voicing patient interfaces with animal research. On research establishment websites, and elsewhere, patients? perspectives are emerging in short films, taking up positions as narrators, tour guides, and commentators, inviting the public to follow them into these previously inaccessible spaces. The embodied experience of patients, sometimes severely affected by the current absences in biomedical research, are used to authorise their presence in these places, and allow them to ask questions of animal researchers. The films are powerful and emotional vehicles for voicing patient experiences and opening up animal research. They also refigure the affective responsibilities around animal research, resituating a public debate around ethics within the body of the patient. The future expectations personified in the abstract figure of the patient, are rendered turbulent in the ambiguous corporeal encounter between human and animals undergoing similar experiences of suffering."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/978-3-030-21406-7_9,"""",31829542,",,,,,,,,

Moving beyond the initial phase of piloting and experimentation, these initiatives are now more clearly focused on the need for effective scaling and integration to provide sustainable benefit to healthcare systems.Based on real-life case studies of scaling digital health in LMICs, five key focus areas have been identified as being critical for success. Firstly, the intrinsic characteristics of the programme or initiative must offer tangible benefits to address an unmet need, with end-user input from the outset. Secondly, all stakeholders must be engaged, trained and motivated to implement a new initiative, and thirdly, the technical profile of the initiative should be driven by simplicity, interoperability and adaptability. The fourth focus area is the policy environment in which the digital healthcare initiative is intended to function, where alignment with broader healthcare policy is essential, as is sustainable funding that will support long-term growth, including private sector funding where appropriate. Finally, the extrinsic ecosystem should be considered, including the presence of the appropriate infrastructure to support the use of digital initiatives at scale.At the global level, collaborative efforts towards a less-siloed approach to scaling and integrating digital health may provide the necessary leadership to enable innovative solutions to reach healthcare workers and patients in LMICs.

Their 24/7 availability and accessibility through a mobile phone allow individuals to obtain help whenever and wherever needed, overcoming financial and logistical barriers. Although psychological AI chatbots have the ability to make significant improvements in providing mental health care services, they do not come without ethical and technical challenges. Some major concerns include providing inadequate or harmful support, exploiting vulnerable populations, and potentially producing discriminatory advice due to algorithmic bias. However, it is not always obvious for users to fully understand the nature of the relationship they have with chatbots. There can be significant misunderstandings about the exact purpose of the chatbot, particularly in terms of care expectations, ability to adapt to the particularities of users and responsiveness in terms of the needs and resources/treatments that can be offered. Hence, it is imperative that users are aware of the limited therapeutic relationship they can enjoy when interacting with mental health chatbots. Ignorance or misunderstanding of such limitations or of the role of psychological AI chatbots may lead to a therapeutic misconception (TM) where the user would underestimate the restrictions of such technologies and overestimate their ability to provide actual therapeutic support and guidance. TM raises major ethical concerns that can exacerbate one's mental health contributing to the global mental health crisis. This paper will explore the various ways in which TM can occur particularly through inaccurate marketing of these chatbots, forming a digital therapeutic alliance with them, receiving harmful advice due to bias in the design and algorithm, and the chatbots inability to foster autonomy with patients."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fdgth.2023.1278186,"""",38026836,PMC10663264",,,,,,,,

In Germany, the concept of 'data donation' has recently come into focus, defined as a legal entitlement to the research use of personal medical data without prior consent, combined with an easy-to-exercise right of the data subjects to opt-out. METHODS: Standardized online interviews of 3,013 individuals, representative of the German online population, were conducted in August 2022 to determine their attitude towards data donation for medical research. RESULTS: A majority of participants supported a consent-free data donation regulation, both for publicly funded (85.1%) and for private medical research (66.4%). Major predictors of a positive attitude towards data donation included (i) sufficient appreciation of the respective kind of research (i.e. public or private), (ii) a reciprocity attitude that patients who benefit from research have a duty to support research, and (iii) sufficient trust in data protection and data control. CONCLUSION: People's attitude towards data donation to medical research is generally positive in Germany and depends upon factors that can be curbed by legislation and internal rules of procedure. Worthy of note, designing data donation in the form of an opt-out regulation does not necessarily mean that the paradigm of informedness has to be abandoned. Rather the process of information provision must be shifted towards the creation of basic knowledge in the general population about the risks and benefits of data-intensive medical research ('health data literacy')."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e27933,"""",38509969,PMC10951576",,,,,,,,

METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 20) with stakeholders (clinical geneticists, data scientists, bioinformaticians, industry and patient support group spokespersons) who design and/or work with computational phenotyping (CP) systems. The method of constant comparison was used to analyse the interview data. RESULTS: Interviewees emphasized the importance of establishing trust in the use of CP technology in identifying rare diseases. Trust was formulated in two interrelated ways in these data.

Seamless, online access to integrated electronic health records for citizens is still far from becoming a reality. The implementation of personally managed health data systems still needs to overcome several interoperability, usability, ethics, security, and regulatory issues to deliver the envisioned benefits. This paper offers a policy viewpoint on how the new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) may benefit the implementation of eHealth systems for the management of personal health information for citizens. Interoperability facilitates sharing of health and illness experiences, coordinated care and research for citizen empowerment and improved health outcomes. The adoption of principles relevant to core interoperability and generic user needs and expectations, as described in the new EIF, in line with European and national regulations are quite essential for the development of safe and secure patient access services to support mobility. An interoperability framework facilitates the creation of the appropriate context in which personal health record applications can be designed and implemented in support of disease specific solutions, such as chronic non-malignant pain, diabetes and cancer. It is evident that no solution will fit all circumstances. However, the new EIF, when adapted for personally managed health data, provides a useful and relevant framework to facilitate implementation and adoption of personal health record systems within a coordinated care environment. Practical implications of this work relate to the need of multi-disciplinary cooperation and European level compatibility and sustainability of the underlying infrastructures required to support reliable and secure access to and sharing of medical data, as well as the readiness to address continuously evolving functional and non-functional requirements for regional, national, and cross-border settings."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103166,Continuity of Patient Care",Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration,*Empowerment,Europe,Humans,"*Systems Integration,30978512,",,,

However, there is a lack of knowledge about students learning processes using technology and 3D images. To understand how to facilitate and support the learning of anatomy, there is a need to know more about the student perspectives on how they can use and benefit from 3D images. METHODS: This study used designed educational sessions informed by Educational Design Research to investigate the role of technology-enhanced 3D images in students' anatomy learning. Twenty-four students representing different health professions and multiple study levels, and one tutor, participated in the study. A visualisation table was used to display the images of real patient cases related to disorders associated with the abdomen and the brain. Students were asked to explore the images on their own and audio/video capture was used to record their words and actions. Directly following the session, students were interviewed about their perceptions and different ways of learning and studying anatomy. The tutor was interviewed about his reflections on the session and his role as a facilitator on two occasions. Content analysis was used in its manifest and latent form in the data analysis. RESULT: Two main categories describing the students' and tutor's accounts of learning using the visualisation table were identified: 1. Interpreting 3D images and 2. Educational sessions using visualisation tables. Each category had signifying themes representing interpretations of the latent meaning of the students' and tutor's accounts. These were: Realism and complexity", Processes of discernment, References to previous knowledge, Exploring on one's own is valuable, Context enhances learning experiences," Combinations of learning resources are needed and Working together affects the dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies several important factors to be considered when designing effective and rewarding educational sessions using a visualization table and 3D images in anatomy education. Visualisation of authentic images has the potential to create interest and meaningfulness in studying anatomy. Students need time to actively explore images but also get tutor guidance to understand.

In terms of learning outcomes, improved clinical reasoning skills and knowledge acquisition have been shown. For further exploring the role of virtual patients in medical education, a greater focus on context-specific cases, combined with suitable educational activities, has been suggested. A knowledge gap has been identified in cultural competence in primary care. As primary care physicians are often the main medical providers for patients with refugee backgrounds, they would probably benefit from improved training focusing on how to apply cultural competence in everyday work. Using virtual patient cases, as a complement to clinical training, may be one way forward. The aim of this study was therefore to explore a learner perspective on the educational use of a virtual patient system designed to contribute to training in cultural competence in a primary care context. METHODS: Three virtual patient cases portraying patients with refugee backgrounds were developed. The cases addressed various issues and symptoms common in primary care consultations, while also incorporating intercultural aspects. The system also provided the informants with individualized feedback. Primary care physicians and medical students were invited to test the cases and participate in an interview about their experience. Data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis generated the theme Virtual patients might help improve cultural competence in physicians and medical students by complementing knowledge gained through the informal curriculum. Informants at different educational levels found it suitable as a tool for introducing the topic and for reflecting on one's own consultations. It could also compensate for the predominant informal manner of learning cultural competence, described by the informants. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual patients could be useful for gaining cultural competence in a primary care context.

Among the respondents, 46.8%, 50.2%, 56.8% and 62.3% gained increased insight into roles and responsibilities, values and ethics, interprofessional communication, and teams and teamwork, respectively. In ascending order, students were most satisfied with the learning outcomes from the supervision (16.0%), the syllabus (28.6%), the submission assignment (42.4%), the digital learning content of Canvas (43.8%), the combination of everything (43.8%), and the IPL group discussions (78.6%). In stratified analyses, 'teacher education and child welfare students' were significantly more likely to gain better insight into the WHO competencies than """"health and social care students"""", and they were also more overall satisfied. CONCLUSION: Students agreed that blended learning was a suitable approach, although the learning outcomes from the face-to-face discussions were markedly higher than from other course components. While the majority had learnt something about the WHO competencies, the teacher and child welfare students achieved the best learning outcomes, including new knowledge about the WHO competencies."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2147/JMDH.S325086,"""",34447252,PMC8384144",,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to establish a predictive model for suboptimal cytoreductive surgery (SCS) (residual tumor of > 1 cm) using preoperative and intraoperative determination of the PCI. METHODS: In total, 110 consecutive patients treated for advanced ovarian cancer during a 4-year period in our institution were assessed. Eighty of these patients were eligible for primary debulking surgery and thus included in the present study. All data were prospectively collected and retrospectively evaluated. We determined the PCI both preoperatively and intraoperatively and assessed postoperative complications. RESULTS: A PCI of > 20 was the best cut-off with which to predict a risk of SCS among all three diagnostic techniques assessed in this study (computed tomography, laparoscopy, and laparotomy). Intraoperative PCI determination was associated with the lowest risk of false negatives for SCS when detecting a PCI of < 20. The combination of preoperative computed tomography and laparoscopy, when both techniques predicted SCS, was associated with the lowest risk of false positives for SCS when detecting a PCI of > 20. CONCLUSION: The combination of computed tomography and laparoscopy to obtain the PCI can help to determine which patients with advanced ovarian cancer are suitable for primary debulking surgery and which should undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12957-018-1339-0,""Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous/pathology/surgery",Adult,Aged,"Aged, 80 and over","Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/pathology/surgery",Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects,Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology/surgery,Female,

Telerehabilitation has emerged as a potential methodology for delivering health care within the CBR framework. However, the accessibility of telerehabilitation presents unique challenges for children with disabilities (CWD) in communities with low socioeconomic status. This phenomenological qualitative study explores the barriers and facilitators that influence the participation of families of CWD in telerehabilitation as a method of CBR in urban poor communities. Nine focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted involving 75 primary caregivers of CWD. Inductive thematic analysis using NVivo software was employed to analyze the collected data, revealing four themes that impact participation in Telerehabilitation: Economic and Social Resources, Self-Competency Affecting Transition, Flexible Service Delivery Mechanism, and Safety and Security as a Threat to Participation. The findings emphasize the intricate interplay of factors influencing the accessibility of telerehabilitation services for CWD from low-income households. Actionable strategies to address these challenges include providing affordable technology and internet access, offering training and support to families, developing culturally sensitive resources, establishing safety protocols, and advocating for inclusive policies and funding mechanisms. Collaboration among healthcare professionals, policymakers, and families is essential in building a resilient and equitable healthcare system that prioritizes the needs of CWD living in poverty.

Many of these challenges have an under-examined ethical dimension. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services (PERCS), built from a literature review and ongoing research. PERCS has 7 domains-the reason for consulting, the patient, the clinical relationship, the home and family, technologies, staff, the healthcare organization, and the wider system-and considers how these domains interact and evolve over time as a complex system. It focuses attention on the organization's digital maturity and digital inclusion efforts. We have found that both during and beyond the pandemic, policymakers envisaged an efficient, safe and accessible remote consultation service delivered through state-of-the art digital technologies and implemented via rational allocation criteria and quality standards. In contrast, our empirical data reveal that strategic decisions about establishing remote consultation services, allocation decisions for appointment type (phone, video, e-, face-to-face), and clinical decisions when consulting remotely are fraught with contradictions and tensions-for example, between demand management and patient choice-leading to both large- and small-scale ethical dilemmas for managers, support staff, and clinicians. These dilemmas cannot be resolved by standard operating procedures or algorithms. Rather, they must be managed by attending to here-and-now practicalities and emergent narratives, drawing on guiding principles applied with contextual judgement. We complement the PERCS framework with a set of principles for informing its application in practice, including education of professionals and patients."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fdgth.2021.726095,"""",34713199,PMC8521880",,,,,,,,

However, conventional visual inspection methods have low and inconsistent detection rates. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the HRNetV2 deep learning model for intelligent bladder lesion detection, focusing on its performance at different image resolutions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 94 patients undergoing cystoscopy or transurethral resection of bladder tumor and collected 102 white-light cystoscopy videos between July 2022 and July 2023. Frames containing suspected bladder lesions were manually annotated. HRNetV2, a semantic segmentation model, was used to identify tumor-related morphological features. Images were categorized as high- or low-resolution, and the dataset was split into training and test sets (4:1 ratio). Diagnostic performance was assessed using sensitivity, precision, and mean Dice (mDice) score. RESULTS: A total of 33,657 frames were annotated. The overall sensitivity and precision for the test set were 91.6% and 91.3%, respectively, with an mDice score of 80.3%. In the high-resolution group, sensitivity and precision were 94.8% and 94.4%, while in the low-resolution group, they were 75.6% and 74.8%. The mDice scores for high- and low-resolution images were 84.7% and 56.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HRNetV2 demonstrated excellent performance, particularly with high-resolution images, offering high sensitivity and precision in bladder lesion detection. The results suggest that HRNetV2 has significant potential to improve detection accuracy in clinical practice. Future work should focus on optimizing the model further and testing it with larger, multicenter datasets."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1245/s10434-025-17015-3,"""",40050483,",,,,,,,,

While several studies have addressed the issue of governance of big data in clinical research from the legal or ethical perspectives, the viewpoint of local research ethics committee (REC) members is underrepresented in the current literature. The aim of this study is therefore to find which specific ethical challenges are raised by RECs in the context of a large European study on remote monitoring in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's disease, and what gaps remain. METHODS: Documents describing the REC review process at 10 sites in 9 European countries from the project Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR-AD) were collected and translated. Main themes emerging in the documents were identified using a qualitative analysis approach. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged after analysis: data management, participant's wellbeing, methodological issues, and the issue of defining the regulatory category of RMTs. Review processes differed across sites: process duration varied from 71 to 423 days, some RECs did not raise any issues, whereas others raised up to 35 concerns, and the approval of a data protection officer was needed in half of the sites. DISCUSSION: The differences in the ethics review process of the same study protocol across different local settings suggest that a multi-site study would benefit from a harmonization in research ethics governance processes. More specifically, some best practices could be included in ethical reviews across institutional and national contexts, such as the opinion of an institutional data protection officer, patient advisory board reviews of the protocol and plans for how ethical reflection is embedded within the study."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pone.0285807,""Humans","*Ethics Committees, Research",*Alzheimer Disease,Ethical Review,"Ethics, Research","Europe"",37418385,PMC10328231",,,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the generalizability of the 7 ethical research principles for clinical trials endorsed by the National Institute of Health (NIH), and identify ethical concerns unique to clinical trials of AI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study included semistructured interviews conducted with 11 investigators engaged in the design and implementation of clinical trials of AI for DR screening from November 11, 2022, to February 20, 2023. The study was a collaboration with the ACCESS (AI for Children's Diabetic Eye Exams) trial, the first clinical trial of autonomous AI in pediatrics. Participant recruitment initially utilized purposeful sampling, and later expanded with snowball sampling.

Over the last two decades, MERS, Ebola, and other emerging infectious diseases each posed unique challenges for applying quarantine ethics lessons learned from the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. In an increasingly interdependent and connected global world, the use of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, similarly poses new and unexpected ethical challenges. In this essay, we look beyond standard debates about the ethics of quarantine and state power to explore a key quarantine principle, Reciprocity, and how it is being negotiated by healthcare workers, volunteers, and citizens in the context of the Wuhan, China, quarantine. We analyze Reciprocity through the lens of two Wuhan case studies: (1) healthcare workers, particularly nurses, who are simultaneously essential workers and quarantined citizens, asked by their hospital administration to shave their heads because adequate PPE was not available, and (2) citizen-to-citizen mutual aid societies attempting to fill gaps in essential supplies left unfilled by the state. We analyze social media and video-blogs from Wuhan, on the platforms of Douyin and Sina Weibo, to understand how people define and respond to ethical and legal obligations in the wake of COVID-19. It is no surprise that quarantine principles from the 2003 SARS outbreak are inadequate for COVID-19 and that both infectious disease outbreak responses and ethics must adapt to the virtual age.

We examined technology surveillance using mobile thermometer detectors (MTDs), knowledge of App, and self-efficacy as a means of sensing body temperature as a measure of COVID-19 risk mitigation. In a cross-sectional survey, we explored COVID-19 risk mitigation, mobile temperature detectable by network syndromic surveillance mobility, detachable from clinicians, and laboratory diagnoses to elucidate the magnitude of community monitoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, we create in-depth comprehension of risk mitigation, mobile temperature Thermometer detector, and other variables for surveillance and monitoring among 850 university students and healthcare workers. An applied structural equation model was adopted for analysis with Amos v.24. We established that mobile usability knowledge of APP could effectively aid in COVID-19 intelligence risk mitigation. Moreover, both self-efficacy and mobile temperature positively strengthened data visualization for public health decision-making. RESULTS: The algorithms utilize a validated point-of-center test to ascertain the HealthCode scanning system for a positive or negative COVID-19 notification.

RESULTS: Engaging in more than two types of social participation was associated with higher digital literacy: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.965, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.567-2.465 for two types of participation, and aOR 2.558, 95% CI 2.040-3.208 for more than three types of participation. Additionally, social participation occurring less than once a month and most types of offline activities were associated with improved digital literacy. However, senior community activities were negatively associated with digital literacy (aOR 0.762"," 95% CI 0.681-0.852). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of older Korean adults, it was found that the lower the social participation, the poorer the digital literacy. This association may induce the isolation of older adults from societies especially for older adults with senior community activities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40359-024-02146-1,""Humans",*Social Participation,Aged,Male,Female,Republic of Korea,Cross-Sectional Studies,

Little is known about the current use of e-learning in postgraduate medical education. To determine utilization of e-learning by United States internal medicine residency programs, program director (PD) perceptions of e-learning, and associations between e-learning use and residency program characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a national survey in collaboration with the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine of all United States internal medicine residency programs. RESULTS: Of the 368 PDs, 214 (58.2%) completed the e-learning survey. Use of synchronous e-learning at least sometimes, somewhat often, or very often was reported by 85 (39.7%)"," 153 programs (71.5%) use asynchronous e-learning at least sometimes, somewhat often, or very often.

CONCLUSIONS: Residency programs could be better resourced to integrate e-learning technologies. Asynchronous e-learning was used more than synchronous, which may be to accommodate busy resident schedules and duty-hour restrictions.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) methodology provides an evidence-based framework for optimizing staffing levels. However, manual implementation of the WISN methodology is labour-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. To address these challenges, the Platform for Resource Allocation and Optimization for Healthcare Facilities (PRAYOJN) platform was developed as a web-based tool to automate WISN calculations, streamline data analysis, and improve workforce planning. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a web-based system that automates the WISN methodology for healthcare workforce planning. METHODS: The PRAYOJN platform was developed using an agile methodology, structured over five iterative sprints. These sprints incorporated stakeholder feedback to refine system functionalities, ensuring adaptability to real-world healthcare needs. The platform integrates data for principal, supporting, and ancillary tasks to calculate staffing requirements. Key functionalities include automated computation of Available Work Time (AWT), Standard Workload (SW), Category Allowance Factor (CAF), and Individual Allowance Factor (IAF). Alpha testing validated usability and accuracy, while beta testing in a clinical phlebotomy department assessed real-world performance. RESULTS: The platform calculated an ideal staffing requirement of 15.53 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) for the phlebotomy department, aligning closely with the current staff strength of 15 FTE. Agile development ensured iterative improvements, enhancing user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). Feedback highlighted the platform's user-friendly design, with dynamic visualizations such as pie charts and bar graphs aiding workload interpretation. Users praised its efficiency, adaptability, and role in reducing calculation complexity. CONCLUSION: PRAYOJN modernizes and enhances WISN-based workforce planning by automating workload calculations, improving data visualization, and supporting real-time decision-making. Its scalability and intuitive interface position it as a valuable tool for optimizing staffing efficiency across diverse healthcare environments."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-025-12473-7,*Workload",Humans,*Resource Allocation,*Internet,"Personnel Staffing and Scheduling,40102889,PMC11916971",,,,

Digital peer support involves live or automated peer support services delivered through technology media such as peer-to-peer networks, smartphone apps, and asynchronous and synchronous technologies. Supervision standards for digital peer support can determine important administrative, educative, and supportive guidelines for supervisors to maintain the practice of competent digital peer support, develop knowledgeable and skilled digital peer support specialists, clarify the role and responsibility of digital peer support specialists, and support specialists in both an emotional and developmental capacity. OBJECTIVE: Although digital peer support has expanded recently, there are no formal digital supervision standards. The aim of this study is to inform the development of supervision standards for digital peer support and introduce guidelines that supervisors can use to support, guide, and develop competencies in digital peer support specialists. METHODS: Peer support specialists that currently offer digital peer support services were recruited via an international email listserv of 1500 peer support specialists. Four 1-hour focus groups, with a total of 59 participants, took place in October 2020. Researchers used Rapid and Rigorous Qualitative Data Analysis methods. Researchers presented data transcripts to focus group participants for feedback and to determine if the researcher's interpretation of the data match their intended meanings. RESULTS: We identified 51 codes and 11 themes related to the development of supervision standards for digital peer support. Themes included (1) education on technology competency (43/197, 21.8%), (2) education on privacy, security, and confidentiality in digital devices and platforms (33/197, 16.8%), (3) education on peer support competencies and how they relate to digital peer support (25/197, 12.7%), (4) administrative guidelines (21/197, 10.7%), (5) education on the digital delivery of peer support (18/197, 9.1%), (6) education on technology access (17/197, 8.6%), (7) supervisor support of work-life balance (17/197, 8.6%), (8) emotional support (9/197, 4.6%), (9) administrative documentation (6/197, 3%), (10) education on suicide and crisis intervention (5/197, 2.5%), and (11) feedback (3/197, 1.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Currently, supervision standards from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for in-person peer support include administrative, educative, and supportive functions. However, digital peer support has necessitated supervision standard subthemes such as education on technology and privacy, support of work-life balance, and emotional support. Lack of digital supervision standards may lead to a breach in ethics and confidentiality, workforce stress, loss of productivity, loss of boundaries, and ineffectively serving users who participate in digital peer support services. Digital peer support specialists require specific knowledge and skills to communicate with service users and deliver peer support effectively, while supervisors require new knowledge and skills to effectively develop, support, and manage the digital peer support role."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/40607,"""",37335603,PMC10337386",,,,,,,,

The danger of untrustworthy AI often culminates with Deepfake, perceived as unprecedented threat for democracies and online trust, through its potential to back sophisticated disinformation campaigns. Little work has, however, been dedicated to the examination of the concept of trust, what undermines the arguments supporting such initiatives. By investigating the concept of trust and its evolutions, this paper ultimately defends a non-intuitive position: Deepfake is not only incapable of contributing to such an end, but also offers a unique opportunity to transition towards a framework of social trust better suited for the challenges entailed by the digital age. Discussing the dilemmas traditional societies had to overcome to establish social trust and the evolution of their solution across modernity, I come to reject rational choice theories to model trust and to distinguish an 'instrumental rationality' and a 'social rationality'. This allows me to refute the argument which holds Deepfake to be a threat to online trust. In contrast, I argue that Deepfake may even support a transition from instrumental to social rationality, better suited for making decisions in the digital age."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s43681-021-00072-1,"""",34790952,PMC8237779",,,,,,,,

Yet, patients' attitudes regarding social media recruitment are underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This mixed methods study aims to assess predictors of the acceptance of social media recruitment among patients with hepatitis B, a patient population that is considered particularly vulnerable in this context. METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach, the hypotheses for our survey were developed based on a qualitative interview study with 6 patients with hepatitis B and 30 multidisciplinary experts. Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative interview analysis. For the cross-sectional survey, we additionally recruited 195 patients with hepatitis B from 3 clinical centers in Germany. Adult patients capable of judgment with a hepatitis B diagnosis who understood German and visited 1 of the 3 study centers during the data collection period were eligible to participate. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 28"," IBM Corp), including descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: On the basis of the qualitative interview analysis, we hypothesized that 6 factors were associated with acceptance of social media recruitment: using social media in the context of hepatitis B (hypothesis 1), digital literacy (hypothesis 2), interest in clinical studies (hypothesis 3), trust in nonmedical (hypothesis 4a) and medical (hypothesis 4b) information sources, perceiving the hepatitis B diagnosis as a secret (hypothesis 5a), attitudes toward data privacy in the social media context (hypothesis 5b), and perceived stigma (hypothesis 6). Regression analysis revealed that the higher the social media use for hepatitis B (hypothesis 1), the higher the interest in clinical studies (hypothesis 3), the more trust in nonmedical information sources (hypothesis 4a), and the less secrecy around a hepatitis B diagnosis (hypothesis 5a), the higher the acceptance of social media as a recruitment tool for clinical hepatitis B studies. CONCLUSIONS: This mixed methods study provides the first quantitative insights into social media acceptance for clinical study recruitment among patients with hepatitis B. The study was limited to patients with hepatitis B in Germany but sets out to be a reference point for future studies assessing the attitudes toward and acceptance of social media recruitment for clinical studies. Such empirical inquiries can facilitate the work of researchers designing clinical studies as well as ethics review boards in balancing the risks and benefits of social media recruitment in a context-specific manner."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/54034,Humans",*Social Media,*Hepatitis B/psychology,*Patient Selection,Female,Male,Adult,

Even in countries with mature patient online record access, access to psychotherapy notes is not mandatory. To date, no research has explored the views of psychotherapy trainees about open notes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the opinions of psychotherapy trainees in Switzerland about patients' access to psychotherapists' free-text summaries. METHODS: We administered a web-based mixed methods survey to 201 psychotherapy trainees to explore their familiarity with and opinions about the impact on patients and psychotherapy practice of offering patients online access to their psychotherapy notes. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the 42-item survey, and qualitative descriptive analysis was employed to examine written responses to four open-ended questions. RESULTS: Seventy-two (35.8%) trainees completed the survey. Quantitative results revealed mixed views about open notes. 75% agreed that, in general open notes were a good idea, and 94.1% agreed that education about open notes should be part of psychotherapy training. When considering impact on patients and psychotherapy, four themes emerged: (a) negative impact on therapy", (b) positive impact on therapy, (c) impact on patients," and (d) documentation. Students identified concerns related to increase in workload, harm to the psychotherapeutic relationship, and compromised quality of records. They also identified many potential benefits including better patient communication and informed consent processes. In describing impact on different therapy types, students believed that open notes might have differential impact depending on the psychotherapy approaches.

Unfortunately, none of the currently available tools fully mimic clinical assessment or cover a wide range of STIs. METHODS: We prospectively invited attendees presenting with STI-related symptoms at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre to answer gender-specific questionnaires covering the symptoms of 12 common STIs using a computer-assisted self-interviewing system between 2015 and 2018. Then, we developed an online symptom checker (iSpySTI.org) using Bayesian networks. In this study, various machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated for their ability to predict these STI and anogenital conditions. We used the Z-test to compare their average area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores with the Bayesian networks for diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: The study population included 6,162 men (median age 30, IQR: 26-38"," approximately 40% of whom had sex with men in the past 12 months) and 4,358 women (median age 27, IQR: 24-31). Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) (23.6%, 1447/6121), genital warts (11.7%, 718/6121) and balanitis (8.9%, 546/6121) were the most common conditions in men. Candidiasis (16.6%, 722/4538) and bacterial vaginosis (16.2%, 707/4538) were the most common conditions in women. During evaluation with unseen datasets, machine learning models performed well for most male conditions, with the AUC ranging from 0.81 to 0.95, except for urinary tract infections (UTI) (AUC 0.72). Similarly, the models achieved AUCs ranging from 0.75 to 0.95 for female conditions, except for cervicitis (AUC 0.58). Urethral discharge and other urinary symptoms were important features for predicting urethral gonorrhoea, NGU and UTIs. Similarly, participants selected skin images that were similar to their own lesions, and the location of the anogenital skin lesions were also strong predictors. The vaginal discharge (odour, colour) and itchiness were important predictors for bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis. The performance of the machine learning models was significantly better than Bayesian models for male balanitis, molluscum contagiosum and genital warts (P < 0.05) but was similar for the other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Both machine learning and Bayesian models could predict correct diagnoses with reasonable accuracy using prospectively collected data for 12 STIs and other common anogenital conditions.

Although the services have been proven to benefit patients, little is known about the satisfaction of healthcare providers (HCPs) who run the services. This study utilizes the extended Technology Acceptance Model to evaluate the satisfaction of HCPs with VCS and identify associated factors to further improve these services. OBJECTIVES:  In this study, we aimed to determine the proportion of HCPs who were satisfied with the VCS and identify factors contributing to this satisfaction. METHODOLOGY:  A cross-sectional study was conducted among 42 government health clinics in Selangor, Malaysia, using an online survey comprising a validated questionnaire of the extended Technology Acceptance Model. A total of 137 HCPs from various categories responded to the online survey. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression.

In this study, we identified clinical, organizational and regulatory, and ethical and social (CORES) issues, including recommendations, associated with deploying MediLinker, and blockchain in general, for clinical testing. METHODS: CORES issues and recommendations were identified through a focus group with 11 academic, industry, and government experts on March 26, 2021. They were grouped according to their expertise: clinical care (n = 4), organizational and regulatory concerns (n = 4), and ethical and social issues (n = 3). The focus group was conducted via Zoom in which experts were briefed about the study aims, formed into breakout groups to identify key issues based on their group's expertise, and reconvened to share identified issues with other groups and to discuss potential recommendations to address such issues. The focus group was video recorded and transcribed. The resulting transcriptions and meeting notes were imported to MAXQDA 2018 for thematic analysis. RESULTS: Clinical experts identified issues that concern the clinical system, clinical administrators, clinicians, and patients. Organizational and regulatory experts emphasized issues on accountability, compliance, and legal safeguards. Ethics and social-context experts raised issues on trust, transparency, digital divide, and health-related digital autonomy. Accordingly, experts proposed six recommendations that could address most of the identified issues: (1) design interfaces based on patient preferences, (2) ensure testing with diverse populations, (3) ensure compliance with existing policies, (4) present potential positive outcomes to top management, (5) maintain clinical workflow, and (6) increase the public's awareness of blockchain. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a myriad of CORES issues associated with deploying MediLinker in clinical settings. Moreover, the study also uncovered several recommendations that could address such issues. The findings raise awareness on CORES issues that should be considered when designing, developing, and deploying blockchain for healthcare. Further, the findings provide additional insights into the development of MediLinker from a prototype to a minimum viable product for clinical testing.

However, relatively little work has assessed or validated textural feature algorithms using raw full field digital mammograms (FFDM). METHOD: A case-control study nested within a screening cohort (age 46-73 years) from Manchester UK was used to develop a texture feature risk score (264 cases diagnosed at the same time as mammogram of the contralateral breast, 787 controls) using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for 112 features, and validated in a second case-control study from the same cohort but with cases diagnosed after the index mammogram (317 cases, 931 controls). Predictive ability was assessed using deviance and matched concordance index (mC). The ability to improve risk estimation beyond percent volumetric density (Volpara) was evaluated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The strongest features identified in the training set were """"sum average"""" based on the grey-level co-occurrence matrix at low image resolutions (original resolution 10.628 pixels per mm"," downsized by factors of 16, 32 and 64), which had a better deviance and mC than volumetric PD.

Methods: A consensus approach was taken during a three-day workshop using a purposive sample of global mHealth stakeholders (n = 27) professionally and geographically spread. Throughout a series of introductory talks, group brainstorming, plenary reviews, and synthesis by the moderators, lists of actions were generated that address the concerns engendered by mHealth applications on autonomy, justice and safety, taking into account the development, implementation, and scale-up phases of an mHealth application lifecycle. Results: Several types of actions were recommended"," key ones among them included building in risk mitigation measures from the development stage, establishing inclusive consultation processes, using open sources platform whenever possible, training all clinical users, and bearing in mind that the gold standard of care is face-to-face consultation with the patient. Recommendations of patient, community and health system participation and of governance were identified as cutting across the mHealth lifecycle. Conclusion: Priorities agreed-upon at the meeting echo those put forward concerning other domains and locations of application of mHealth. Those more forcefully articulated are the need to adopt and maintain participatory processes as well as promoting self-governance. They are expected to cut across the mHealth lifecycle and are prerequisites to the safeguard of autonomy, safety and justice."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1080/16549716.2019.1666695,Confidentiality/*ethics",Consensus,Delivery of Health Care,*Diagnostic Imaging,Health Resources/*supply & distribution,Humans,Internationality,

This paper explores how threats and risks are anticipated and acted on in biobanking, which builds research repositories for biomedical samples and data. Focusing on the biggest harmonisation cluster of biomedical research in Europe, BBMRI-ERIC, the paper analyses different logics of risk in the anticipatory discourse on biobanking. Based on document analysis, interviews with ELSI experts, and field research, three types of framing of risk are reconstructed: data security, privacy, and data misuse. The paper finds that these logics downplay the broader social and political context and reflects on the limits of the practices of anticipatory governance in biobanking. It argues that this regime of governance can make it difficult for biobanks to address possible future challenges, such as access to biomedical data by authorities, pressures for integrating biobank data with other type of personal data, or their use for profiling beyond medical purposes. To address potential controversies and societal implications related to the use of big data in health research and medicine, the paper suggests to expand the vocabulary and practices of anticipatory governance, in the biobanking community and beyond."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11948-021-00305-w,*Biological Specimen Banks",*Biomedical Research,Computer Security,Europe,Humans,"Risk Management,33881646,PMC8058749",,,

At the request of the European Commission, the international Standard Development Organizations (SDOs), European Committee for Standardization, International Organization for Standardization, and International Electrotechnical Commission have joined forces to develop a technical specification (TS) for assessing the quality and reliability of health and wellness apps. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to create a useful, globally applicable, trustworthy, and usable framework to assess health app quality. METHODS: A 2-round Delphi technique with 83 experts from 6 continents (predominantly Europe) participating in one (n=42, 51%) or both (n=41, 49%) rounds was used to achieve consensus on a framework for assessing health app quality. Aims included identifying the maximum 100 requirement questions for the uptake of apps that do or do not qualify as medical devices. The draft assessment framework was built on 26 existing frameworks, the principles of stringent legislation, and input from 20 core experts. A follow-up survey with 28 respondents informed a scoring mechanism for the questions. After subsequent alignment with related standards, the quality assessment framework was tested and fine-tuned with manufacturers of 11 COVID-19 symptom apps. National mirror committees from the 52 countries that participated in the SDO technical committees were invited to comment on 4 working drafts and subsequently vote on the TS. RESULTS: The final quality assessment framework includes 81 questions, 67 (83%) of which impact the scores of 4 overarching quality aspects. After testing with people with low health literacy, these aspects were phrased as """"Healthy and safe,"""" """"Easy to use,"""" """"Secure data,"""" and """"Robust build."""" The scoring mechanism enables communication of the quality assessment results in a health app quality score and label, alongside a detailed report. Unstructured interviews with stakeholders revealed that evidence and third-party assessment are needed for health app uptake. The manufacturers considered the time needed to complete the assessment and gather evidence (2-4 days) acceptable. Publication of CEN-ISO/TS 82304-2:2021 Health software - Part 2: Health and wellness apps - Quality and reliability was approved in May 2021 in a nearly unanimous vote by 34 national SDOs, including 6 of the 10 most populous countries worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: A useful and usable international standard for health app quality assessment was developed. Its quality, approval rate, and early use provide proof of its potential to become the trusted, commonly used global framework. The framework will help manufacturers enhance and efficiently demonstrate the quality of health apps, consumers, and health care professionals to make informed decisions on health apps. It will also help insurers to make reimbursement decisions on health apps."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/43905,"""",36538379,PMC9872976",,,,,,,,

Some examples include text-based digital triage and health guidance using chats, emails, images and pre-filled forms. Telephone-based communication has until recent years been the predominant means for triage and health guidance, but now includes written communication via computer or smartphone. Hence conditions to perform triage and health guidance have changed, which may affect the quality of nurses' work and patient safety. This motivates an in-depth exploration of the consequences of such changes for nurses working with telehealth. The study aimed to explore nurses' experiences of digital triage and health guidance at primary healthcare centres in Sweden. METHODS: A qualitative inductive design was chosen for the current study. Four registered nurses and two public health nurses, working at primary healthcare centres in southern Sweden, contributed with information about text-based digital triage and health guidance. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: One main theme, """"Adapting to a new professional toolbox to triage and give health guidance"""" was constructed based on three categories which describe the altered professional tools. They were: """"Using one's senses differently to collect information"""", """"Change of communication mode to convey messages"""" and """"Change of timeframe and the use of time"""". Six subcategories describe how the new toolbox was experienced by the nurses. They were: """"Loss of clinical ear"""", """"Gain of viewing images"""", """"Difficulties in written communication of care and emotions"""", """"Seeing oneself as a writer or talker"""", """"Tardy asynchronous communication"""" and """"Available time"""". CONCLUSION: The findings tell of a substantial change in nurses' professional toolbox that demanded other skills than they were used to working with. Due to limitations in communication and communication skills, digital triage alone may lead to an impaired workflow, quality of care, and patient safety as well as maintain the digital divide. However, digital triage may also enhance nurses' work with the addition of attached images, convenient communication for those who are comfortable with writing, and a gain of time for consultation and reflection. The current study contributes insights regarding new competencies that nurses and patients must have or gain to be able to benefit from the possibilities of digitisation of primary healthcare."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12912-025-02683-z,"""",39810184,PMC11730147",,,,,,,,United States/epidemiology

The process of cultivating dialogue is shaped by the context in which it occurs, yet the development of interventions addressing vaccine hesitancy with dialogue often overlooks the role of context and favors relatively fixed solutions. This reflexive paper shares three key lessons related to context for dialogue-based interventions. These lessons emerged during a participatory research project to develop a pilot intervention to create open dialogue among healthcare workers in Belgium about COVID-19 vaccination concerns. Through a mixed methods study consisting of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and surveys, we engaged healthcare workers in the design, testing, and evaluation of a digital platform featuring text-based and video-based (face-to-face) interactions. The lessons are: (1) what dialogue means, entails, and requires can vary for a population and context, (2) inherent tension exists between helping participants voice (and overcome) their concerns and exposing them to others' ideas that may exacerbate those concerns, and (3) interactional exchanges (e.g., with peers or experts) that matter to participants may shape the dialogue in terms of its content and form. We suggest that having a discovery-orientation-meaning to work not only inductively and iteratively but also reflexively-is a necessary part of the development of dialogue-based interventions. Our case also sheds light on the influences between: dialogue topic/content, socio-political landscape, population, intervention aim, dialogue form, ethics, researcher position, and types of interactional exchanges."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fpubh.2023.1069199,Humans",Vaccination Hesitancy,COVID-19 Vaccines,*COVID-19,Vaccination,"*Vaccines,36891336,PMC9986323",,,

This is the premise of the Academic Research Organization (ARO) Council, which was initiated in Japan in 2013 and has since been expanding throughout Asia and into Europe and the United States. The volume of data is growing exponentially, providing not only challenges but also the clear opportunity to understand and treat diseases in ways not previously considered. Harnessing the knowledge within the data in a successful way can provide researchers and clinicians with new ideas for therapies while avoiding repeats of failed experiments. This knowledge transfer from research into clinical care is at the heart of a learning health system. METHODS: The ARO Council wishes to form a worldwide complementary system for the benefit of all patients and investigators, catalyzing more efficient and innovative medical research processes. Thus, they have organized Global ARO Network Workshops to bring interested parties together, focusing on the aspects necessary to make such a global effort successful. One such workshop was held in Austin, Texas, in November 2017. Representatives from Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Europe, and the United States reported on their efforts to encourage data sharing and to use research to inform care through learning health systems. RESULTS: This experience report summarizes presentations and discussions at the Global ARO Network Workshop held in November 2017 in Austin, TX, with representatives from Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Europe, and the United States. Themes and recommendations to progress their efforts are explored. Standardization and harmonization are at the heart of these discussions to enable data sharing. In addition, the transformation of clinical research processes through disruptive innovation, while ensuring integrity and ethics, will be key to achieving the ARO Council goal to overcome diseases such that people not only live longer but also are healthier and happier as they age. CONCLUSIONS: The achievement of global learning health systems will require further exploration, consensus-building, funding aligned with incentives for data sharing, standardization, harmonization, and actions that support global interests for the benefit of patients."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1002/lrh2.10073,"""",31245596,PMC6508835",,,,,,,,

Efficient utilization of resources in these secondary hospitals is essential for delivering health services at a lower cost. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the technical efficiency of the DHs in Bangladesh. METHODS: We used input-oriented data envelopment analysis method to estimate the variable returns to scale (VRS) and constant returns to scale (CRS) technical efficiency of the DHs using data from Local Health Bulletin, 2015. In this model, we considered workforce as well as number of inpatient beds as input variables and number of inpatient, outpatient, and maternal services provided by the DHs as output variables. A Tobit regression model was applied for assessing the association of institutional and environmental characteristics with the technical efficiency scores. RESULTS: The average scale, VRS, and CRS technical efficiency of the DHs were estimated to 85%, 92%, and 79% respectively. Population size, poverty headcount, bed occupancy ratio, administrative divisions were significantly associated with the technical efficiency of the DHs. The mean VRS and CRS technical efficiency demonstrated that the DHs, on an average, could reduce their input mix by 8% and 21% respectively while maintaining the same level of output. CONCLUSION: Since the average technical efficiency of the DHs was 79%, there is little scope for overall improvements in these facilities by adjusting inputs. Therefore, we recommend to invest further in the DHs for improvement of services. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) should improve the efficiency in resource allocation by setting an input-mix formula for DHs considering health and socio-economic indicators (e.g., population density, poverty, bed occupancy ratio). The formula can be designed by learning from the input mix in the more efficient DHs. The MoHFW should conduct this kind of benchmarking study regularly to assess the efficiency level of health facilities which may contribute to reduce the wastage of resources and consequently to provide more affordable and accessible public hospital care."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12962-019-0183-6,"""",31367193,PMC6657139",,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear what intensive care unit healthcare professionals expect from such solutions. This study investigated the expectations and concerns of nurses and physicians when implementing telemedicine tools in intensive care units (tele-ICU). METHODS: The study was conducted in intensive care units in 2020 during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It used a mixed-methods approach targeted at physicians and nurses and involved 14 qualitative interviews and 63 quantitative questionnaires. RESULTS: The qualitative and quantitative data showed that both nurses and physicians were willing to use tele-ICU. Nurses recognised the advantages of real-time access to expertise offered by tele-ICU, but feared this would reduce physicians' on-site patient time. Physicians, in turn, were concerned that they would be expected to be continuously on call. The majority in both groups agreed that any tele-ICU solution must be simple to use and integrate easily into existing organisational structures, networks, and work routines. Additionally, COVID-19 significantly influenced expectations: those who reported having more personal health concerns during the pandemic were more predisposed to favour the use of tele-ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, tele-ICU supports better care, but a successful implementation depends on its ease of use and context-sensitive approaches. Effectively integrating tele-ICU solutions into daily clinical routines requires input from nurses and physicians and their involvement in the implementation process from the outset, as well as consideration of existing organisational structures. Such measures will vastly increase the chance of acceptance and successful adoption of telemedical solutions in clinical practice."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1177/20552076241257042,"""",38836049,PMC11149446",,,,,,,,

A few previous studies have applied systems thinking methods, mainly causal loop diagrams, to prioritize interventions and to illustrate the respective implementation context. The present study aimed to explore how systems thinking methods can help decision-makers (1) understand locally specific causes and effects of a key issue and how they are interlinked, (2) identify the most relevant interventions and best fit in the system, and (3) prioritize potential interventions and contextually analyse the system and potential interventions. METHODS: A case study approach was adopted in a regional emergency medical services (EMS) system in Germany. We applied systems thinking methods following three steps: (1) a causal loop diagram (CLD) with causes and effects (variables) of the key issue """"rising EMS demand"""" was developed together with local decision-makers"," (2) targeted interventions addressing the key issue were determined, and impacts and delays were used to identify best intervention variables to determine the system's best fit for implementation"," (3) based on steps 1 and 2, interventions were prioritized and, based on a pathway analysis related to a sample intervention, contextually analysed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven variables were identified in the CLD. All of them, except for the key issue, relate to one of five interlinked subsystems. Five variables were identified as best fit for implementing three potential interventions. Based on predicted implementation difficulty and effect, as well as delays and best intervention variables, interventions were prioritized. The pathway analysis on the example of implementing a standardized structured triage tool highlighted certain contextual factors (e.g. relevant stakeholders, organizations), delays and related feedback loops (e.g. staff resource finiteness) that help decision-makers to tailor the implementation.

Its application in pre-anesthesia consultations (PAC) has the potential to address logistical challenges while maintaining clinical quality. Purpose This study assesses whether telemedicine is a non-inferior alternative to traditional face-to-face pre-anesthesia consultations (PAC) for cancer surgery patients at a tertiary care center and evaluates discrepancies between PAC findings and pre-surgical assessments. Methods This prospective, randomized non-inferiority study included patients aged 20 years or older with access to internet and video calling. The participants were randomly allocated to either a telemedicine PAC or a face-to-face PAC group in a 1:1 ratio. An eight-item questionnaire on a 10-point scale was used to measure patient satisfaction after the consultation, while a 12-item questionnaire on the same scale assessed anesthesiologists' satisfaction. We also compared airway examination findings between the PAC and pre-surgical assessments to detect any discrepancies. Results Of 120 patients assessed, 100 met the inclusion criteria and were randomized (50 per group). Baseline characteristics were similar across groups. Physician satisfaction scores were comparable between telemedicine and face-to-face consultations (7.18 versus 7.58, p=0.113), as were patient satisfaction scores (6.94 versus 7.26, p=0.251). Airway examination findings were consistent, with no significant discrepancies. Conclusion Telemedicine was found to be non-inferior to face-to-face consultations for pre-anesthesia assessments in terms of patient and physician satisfaction, as well as clinical accuracy. These findings support the integration of telemedicine into routine pre-anesthesia practice, particularly in high-demand settings such as cancer care.

While psychological interventions have shown promise in bringing about positive changes in emotional and cognitive domains, there is still limited knowledge on the subjective experiences of change among the participants in these interventions. AIM: The present study explores the experiences of adults with ADHD who had participated in a blended digital and face-to-face intervention aimed at improving emotion dysregulation. The study focuses on understanding their experiences of change and identifying contributors to change. METHODS: A total of 9 adults with ADHD participated in individual semi-structured, in-depth interviews following their participation in the intervention. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The thematic analysis resulted in three core themes. The first theme, 'perceiving change', represents changes that the participants experienced, with four subthemes: 1a) being in control, 1b) feeling aware, 1c) accepting oneself and one's emotions and 1d) gaining insight and knowledge. The second theme, 'supporting change', captures factors that supported the participants' changes, with five subthemes: 2a) acquiring skills, 2b) being in it together, 2c) therapist guidance, 2d) finding motivation 2e) putting it into practice. Lastly, the third theme, 'sustaining change', includes aspects important to maintain change, with two subthemes: 3a) working consistently and 3b) giving it time. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that the participants experienced various changes related to the management of their emotions following their participation in the intervention. Change was perceived as a multifaceted process, supported by internal factors such as motivation and engagement, along with external factors such as support from the other group members and the therapists. Taken together, the findings from the study could be important to the development of psychological interventions for adults with ADHD and may provide valuable knowledge to clinicians and policymakers.

Simulation-based learning (SBL) may provide a safe environment for students to probe the boundaries of ethical encounters. Published studies of ethics simulation have not generated sufficiently deep accounts of student experience to inform pedagogy. The aim of this study was to understand students' lived experiences as they engaged with the emotional challenges of managing clinical ethical dilemmas within a SBL environment. METHODS: This qualitative study was underpinned by an interpretivist epistemology. Eight senior medical students participated in an interprofessional ward-based SBL activity incorporating a series of ethically challenging encounters. Each student wore digital video glasses to capture point-of-view (PoV) film footage. Students were interviewed immediately after the simulation and the PoV footage played back to them. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. An interpretative phenomenological approach, using an established template analysis approach, was used to iteratively analyse the data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) 'Authentic on all levels?', (2)'Letting the emotions flow', (3) 'Ethical alarm bells' and (4) 'Voices of children and ghosts'. Students recognised many explicit ethical dilemmas during the SBL activity but had difficulty navigating more subtle ethical and professional boundaries. In emotionally complex situations, instances of moral compromise were observed (such as telling an untruth). Some participants felt unable to raise concerns or challenge unethical behaviour within the scenarios due to prior negative undergraduate experiences. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided deep insights into medical students' immersive and embodied experiences of ethical reasoning during an authentic SBL activity. By layering on the human dimensions of ethical decision-making, students can understand their personal responses to emotion, complexity and interprofessional working. This could assist them in framing and observing appropriate ethical and professional boundaries and help smooth the transition into clinical practice."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s41077-016-0027-9,"""",29449995,PMC5806291",,,,,,,,

MULTI-PSYCH is a longitudinal cohort of genotyped and phenotyped individuals with depression or anxiety disorders who have undergone highly structured internet-based cognitive-behaviour therapy (ICBT). The overarching purpose of MULTI-PSYCH is to improve risk stratification, outcome prediction and secondary preventive interventions. MULTI-PSYCH is a precision medicine initiative that combines clinical, genetic and nationwide register data. PARTICIPANTS: MULTI-PSYCH includes 2668 clinically well-characterised adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=1300), social anxiety disorder (n=640) or panic disorder (n=728) assessed before, during and after 12 weeks of ICBT at the internet psychiatry clinic in Stockholm, Sweden. All patients have been blood sampled and genotyped. Clinical and genetic data have been linked to several Swedish registers containing a wide range of variables from patient birth up to 10 years after the end of ICBT. These variable types include perinatal complications, school grades, psychiatric and somatic comorbidity, dispensed medications, medical interventions and diagnoses, healthcare and social benefits, demographics, income and more. Long-term follow-up data will be collected through 2029. FINDINGS TO DATE: Initial uses of MULTI-PSYCH include the discovery of an association between PRS for autism spectrum disorder and response to ICBT, the development of a machine learning model for baseline prediction of remission status after ICBT in MDD and data contributions to genome wide association studies for ICBT outcome. Other projects have been launched or are in the planning phase. FUTURE PLANS: The MULTI-PSYCH cohort provides a unique infrastructure to study not only predictors or short-term treatment outcomes, but also longer term medical and socioeconomic outcomes in patients treated with ICBT for depression or anxiety.

It involves engaging participants to create and share their stories using photos, drawings, and audio recordings in short videos. Benefits of DST include enhancing co-creation of knowledge, empowering participants to confront dominant narratives and revise inaccurate representations. We report our experiences and reflections of using DST to explore community perceptions of health concerns in urban Malawi. Community leaders were briefed about the project before and after study related activities. Three participatory workshops were organized to train community members in DST, support them to develop videos and discuss their experiences of DST. Twenty-six participants from two high density urban communities consented to be part of the workshops. They were all new to DST. All the 26 participants were invited together to the three workshops and their DSTs were developed in smaller groups (n = 7), based on their geographical location. Although we engaged residents from selected communities to share priority health concerns, all the seven groups presented challenges pertaining to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), and their powerlessness to address the complex challenges. The collective focus on WASH showed that DST effectively empowered communities to present priority health concerns. The inability of community members to address the challenges without external assistance or failure to use findings from DST to generate social change however raise questions on the ideals of empowerment and social justice. In addition, lack of financial resources or technical know-how to produce digital stories and unequal power relationships between service providers and community, may affect the use of DST for community activism among socio-economically disadvantaged groups. We conclude that DST empowered participants to articulate genuine health challenges that they felt powerless to address.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to assess the usability and perception of a DMR smartphone app for pregnant women. The secondary objective was to assess personal preferences and habits related to online information searching, wearable data presentation and interpretation, at-home examination, and sharing data for research purposes during pregnancy. METHODS: A DMR smartphone app was developed. Key features such as wearable device integration, study functionalities (eg, questionnaires), and common pregnancy app functionalities (eg, mood tracker) were included. Women who had previously given birth were invited to participate. Participants completed 10 tasks while asked to think aloud. Sessions were conducted via Zoom. Video, audio, and the shared screen were recorded for analysis. Task completion times, task success, errors, and self-reported (free text) feedback were evaluated. Usability was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore the secondary objective. RESULTS: A total of 11 participants (mean age 34.6, SD 2.2 years) were included in the study. A mean SUS score of 79.09 (SD 18.38) was achieved. The app was rated """"above average"""" in 4 of 6 UEQ categories. Sixteen unique features were requested.

CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women rely on their medical caregivers for advice, including on the use of mobile and ubiquitous health technology. Clear benefits must be communicated if issuing wearable devices to pregnant women. Participants that experienced pregnancy complications in the past were overall more open toward the use of wearable devices in pregnancy.

There is an absence of the pregnant patient's voice in the research surrounding pregnancy at risk of sPTB. MATERIALS/METHODS: The Preterm Birth Advisory Council was established at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) in January 2023, to introduce and embed the patient voice in research into sPTB prevention. Council members include patients with lived experience of sPTB, patient advocate representatives and clinicians involved in sPTB preventative care. Topics around sPTB prevention were openly discussed with experts by experience and shared with sPTB advocacy groups. Responses were analysed for themes most important to those with lived experience. Ethical approval was granted by NMH Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: In total, seven experts by experience gave their views over the course of a three month period. Six key themes were observed: Clinical Outcomes in Preterm Birth Research. Low priority was placed on the modality, route and duration of interventions. The most important aspect of an intervention is its clinical efficacy. High tolerance thresholds were described in sacrifice for a positive pregnancy outcomePreterm Birth Preventative care as a patient-led care model. While medical and surgical interventions play their role in objectively reducing risk, much of pregnancy care after preterm birth centres on psychological support and continuity of care.Lack of awareness on risk factors for sPTB is an obstacle to timely referral and access to care. Patient experience of preterm birth prevention and timely interventions are improved where risk factor awareness exists.Importance of preconceptual counselling. The unexpected nature of adverse outcome adds additional trauma to the event itself. Anticipation of adverse event can improve sense of control, minimise trauma and increase ability to cope.The partner's experience of pregnancy at risk of preterm birth is largely missing from focus of research and clinical care. Peer-support, digital resources or partner handbooks may be helpful for support persons.Traumatic language included referring to a mid-trimester pregnancy loss or peri-viable preterm birth as a 'miscarriage.' Regarding language around preterm birth, there was no preferred term identified for women with risk factors or experience of preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: The Preterm Birth Advisory Council places the voice of those impacted by preterm birth at the centre of research into its prevention. The themes identified may guide activities within this research area in local settings and international platforms. It is the council's hope that supported by their work, it will be the patient's voice that rings loudest in research in spontaneous preterm birth prevention."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pone.0312370,""Humans",*Premature Birth/prevention & control/psychology,Female,Pregnancy,Advisory Committees,"Infant, Newborn"",39705297,PMC11661579",,,

The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased among adults in Taiwan. Hence, we examined the relationship between dietary patterns and weight status by gender among middle-aged and older adults in Taiwan. METHODS: The cross-sectional data of 62,965 participants aged =40 years were retrieved from the Mei Jau health screening institutions' database collected from 2001 and 2010. Diet information was evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire, while the dietary patterns were derived using principal component analysis before summing up and dividing into quintiles of consumption. The association between dietary patterns and weight status among adult men and women was explored using multinomial logistic regression models. Three models were analyzed before stratifying data by gender. RESULTS: Two dietary patterns were derived with one reflecting a high consumption of vegetables and fruits (vegetable-fruit dietary pattern) and the other a high consumption of meat and processed foods (meat-processed dietary pattern). After adjustment, highest consumption of vegetables and fruits (Q5) reduced the likelihood of being overweight (OR = 0.91"," 95% CI, 0.85-0.97) or obese (OR = 0.85"," 95% CI, 0.78-0.92), while highest consumption of meat and processed foods increased the likelihood of being overweight (OR = 1.50"," 95% CI, 1.40-1.59) or obese (OR = 1.94"," 95% CI, 1.79-2.10).

The finding of an unexpected region of FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) uptake can occur when performing whole-body FDG-PET, raising the possibility of a second primary tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience of second primary cancer incidentally discovered during PET/CT examination performed for pancreatic diseases, during the initial work-up or follow-up after surgical resection. METHODS: In this study, a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively collected data base was performed. Three hundred ninety- nine patients with pancreatic pathology were evaluated by whole body PET/CT imaging from January 2004 to December 2014. Among them, 348 patients were scanned before surgical resection and 51 during the course of their follow-up (pancreatic cancer). Median follow-up time was 29 months (range 14-124). RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (14%) had incidental uptake of FDG in their organs: 31 patients had focal uptake and 25 showed diffuse with or without focal uptake. All patients with focal uptake were investigated, and invasive malignancy was diagnosed in 22 patients: 14 colon, 4 lung, 1 larynx, 1 urothelial, 1 breast cancer, and 1 colon metastasis from pancreatic cancer. Twenty patients underwent resection, and 6 endoscopic removal of colonic polyps. Three patients were not operated for advanced disease, and two patients did not show any pathology (PET/CT false positive). Of the 10 patients investigated for diffuse uptake, no malignancy was found"," none of these patients developed a second cancer during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: As in other malignancies, unexpected FDG uptake can occur in patients having PET/CT investigation for pancreatic diseases. Focal uptake is likely to be a malignancy and deserves further investigations, although the stage and the poor prognosis of primary pancreatic cancer should be kept in mind.

OBJECTIVES: Drawing on a scoping review, analysis of policy in a specific disciplinary context (learning and technology), and reference group discussion, we address concerns regarding research ethics, in research involving emerging technologies through developing novel policy that aims to foster learning through the expression of ethical concepts in research. APPROACH: This paper develops new editorial policy for expression of research ethics in scholarly outputs across disciplines. These guidelines, aimed at authors, reviewers, and editors, are underpinned by: a cross-disciplinary scoping review of existing policy and adherence to these policies","a review of emerging policies, and policies in a specific discipline (learning and technology)"," and,a collective drafting process undertaken by a reference group of journal editors (the authors of this paper). RESULTS: Analysis arising from the scoping review indicates gaps in policy across a wide range of journals (54% have no statement regarding reporting of research ethics), and adherence (51% of papers reviewed did not refer to ethics considerations). Analysis of emerging and discipline-specific policies highlights gaps.

However, a substantial proportion of health research using electronic health records (EHR), data collected and generated during clinical care, is potentially not reproducible mainly due to the fact that the implementation details of most data preprocessing, cleaning, phenotyping and analysis approaches are not systematically made available or shared. With the complexity, volume and variety of electronic health record data sources made available for research steadily increasing, it is critical to ensure that scientific findings from EHR data are reproducible and replicable by researchers. Reporting guidelines, such as RECORD and STROBE, have set a solid foundation by recommending a series of items for researchers to include in their research outputs. Researchers however often lack the technical tools and methodological approaches to actuate such recommendations in an efficient and sustainable manner. RESULTS: In this paper, we review and propose a series of methods and tools utilized in adjunct scientific disciplines that can be used to enhance the reproducibility of research using electronic health records and enable researchers to report analytical approaches in a transparent manner. Specifically, we discuss the adoption of scientific software engineering principles and best-practices such as test-driven development, source code revision control systems, literate programming and the standardization and re-use of common data management and analytical approaches.

Their incidence may be higher in remote locations where healthcare is limited and risk factors, such as smoking and indoor air pollution, are more prevalent. E-health could overcome some healthcare access obstacles in remote locations, but its utilisation has been limited. An improved understanding of barriers and facilitators to the implementation of e-health in remote locations could aid enhanced application of these approaches. METHODS: We performed a qualitative evidence synthesis to explore factors affecting the successful implementation of e-health interventions in remote locations for patients with chronic respiratory diseases. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases for qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Studies were assessed by two researchers, and 41 studies were included in the synthesis. Quality was assessed via the CASP-tool. Findings were coded with Atlas.ti software and categorised based on an adapted Digital Health Equity Framework. RESULTS: Nineteen themes were identified across five levels (individual, interpersonal, community, society and technology), with associated facilitators and barriers for implementation. An important facilitator of e-health was its role as a tool to overcome obstacles of distance and to increase access to care and patients' self-efficacy. Potential barriers included the reduction of in-person interactions and an increased burden of work for healthcare providers. Good quality, usability, adaptability and efficacy of e-health interventions were important for implementation to be successful, as were adaptation to the local setting - including culture and language -and involvement of relevant stakeholders throughout the process. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors affecting the implementation of e-health in remote and rural locations for patients with chronic respiratory disease were identified. Intervention objectives, target population, geographical location, local culture, and available resources should be carefully considered when designing an e-health intervention. These findings can be used to inform the successful design and implementation of future e-health interventions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-024-12050-4,Humans",Chronic Disease/therapy,*Qualitative Research,*Telemedicine,Health Services Accessibility,"Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology,39754241,PMC11699737",,,

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the methods to assess the accuracy of fit and precision of the RPD framework fabricated using conventional and digital (3D printed and milled) methods. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search (Registration Number CRD42023459566) was conducted across different electronic databases like PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Studies investigating RPD fit and precision assessment using various techniques (Visual inspection and pressing test using silicone impression material, 3D digital analyses using a software, light microscopy, digital microscope at 50x, superimposition method /surface matching software program, µCT on silicone specimens and direct measurements) in in-vitro studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed to evaluate the methodological rigour of the selected studies. A narrative synthesis of the findings was carried out to evaluate the methods to assess the accuracy of fit and precision of the RPD framework fabricated through conventional and digital methods due to heterogeneity in study variables. RESULTS: Out of 413 records, a total of 8 in-vitro studies were included in this review. The key findings of the review suggest that RPD fit accuracy varies across fabrication processes including conventional techniques, resin milling, selective laser melting (SLM), and digital superimposition. Resin milling with polyether ether ketone (PEEK) offers the best accuracy. Among the different methods used in assessing the fit accuracy of the RPD framework silicone-based fit evaluation and superimposition techniques/ surface matching are commonly used methods. CONCLUSION: Both traditional (non-computerized) and computerized methods for the assessment of fit and precision of conventional and digital RPD frameworks are used commonly. But still, formulation of a standard method for fit assessment of RPDs is warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Citizens' juries are a form of deliberative democracy eliciting informed judgment from a representative sample of the general public around policy questions. We organized two 5-day citizens' juries in the UK with 18 jurors each. Jurors considered 3 AI systems with different levels of accuracy and explainability in 2 healthcare and 2 non-healthcare scenarios.

Qualitative data on considerations behind their preferences included transcribed audio-recordings of plenary sessions, observational field notes, outputs from small group work and free-text comments accompanying jurors' votes"," qualitative data were analyzed thematically by scenario, per and across AI systems. RESULTS: In healthcare scenarios, jurors favored accuracy over explainability, whereas in non-healthcare contexts they either valued explainability equally to, or more than, accuracy. Jurors' considerations in favor of accuracy regarded the impact of decisions on individuals and society, and the potential to increase efficiency of services. Reasons for emphasizing explainability included increased opportunities for individuals and society to learn and improve future prospects and enhanced ability for humans to identify and resolve system biases. CONCLUSION: Citizens may value explainability of AI systems in healthcare less than in non-healthcare domains and less than often assumed by professionals, especially when weighed against system accuracy.

RESULTS: The identified influencing factors guiding the contents and format development of 2 new self-care exercises were that pairs of older adults support and learn from each other in performing self-care, which increases their motivation and engagement in practicing self-care at home. The usability test of the 2 new self-care exercises, """"Breathing exercises"""" and """"Picking up from the floor,"""" revealed that the pairs found the exercises and the video feedback component valuable for learning and understanding, for example, by comparison of performances highlighting movement variability. However, they found it difficult to manage the video feedback tool on their own, and a support structure or tailored education or training was requested. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes that the video feedback tool holds the potential to facilitate learning and understanding in self-care management, which may support motivation. The studied video feedback tool can be beneficial for pairs of older adults managing self-care at home as a complement to traditional health care services, but an accurate supporting structure is required.

Approximately 90% of the 105 Swedish NQRs include any patient-reported outcome measure, with EQ-5D being the most common. As there has been no general overview of EQ-5D data within the NQRs, this study fills a knowledge gap by reporting how the data are collected, presented, and used at different levels of the Swedish health care system. METHODS: All 46 NQRs with a license for the use of EQ-5D were included. Information was retrieved from the registries' annual reports or from websites, using a template that was subsequently sent to each registry for completion and confirmation. If considered necessary, the contact was followed-up with an interview, either in-person or over the telephone. The uses of EQ-5D were categorised as denoting usage for follow-up, decision-making, or quality improvement in Swedish health care. RESULTS: In total, 41 of the 46 licensed registries reported collection of EQ-5D data. EQ-5D is most commonly collected within registries related to the musculoskeletal system, but it has a wide application also in other disease areas. Thirty-six registries provide EQ-5D results to patients, clinicians, or other decision-makers. Twenty-two of the registries reported that EQ-5D data are being used for follow-up, decision-making or quality improvement. The registries most commonly reported use of data for assessing interventions, and in quality indicators to follow-up the quality of care at a national level. CONCLUSION: Collection and use of EQ-5D data vary across the Swedish NQRs, which may partly be accounted for by the different purposes of the registries. The provided examples of use illustrate how EQ-5D data can inform decisions at different levels of the health care system. However, there is potential for improving the use of EQ-5D data."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s41687-020-00231-8,"""",32936347,PMC7494720",,,,,,,,

Plagiarism is prevalent across the globe, but the problem is worse in developing countries due to numerous factors, such as social and economic conditions and lack of knowledge. The digital age has further exacerbated the situation, as easy access to artificial intelligence and online content facilitates plagiarism. To combat this problem, it is essential to recognize the importance of originality and the consequences of plagiarism, including damage to one's professional reputation, legal repercussions, and loss of credibility and trust. Educational institutions and publishers can play a crucial role in promoting a culture of fairness by implementing clear guidelines, providing training on ethical research practices, and enforcing strict consequences for violations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 600 pediatric (0-18 years) admissions at a Swedish university hospital during one year were included and stratified in blocks to 150 neonatal, surgical/orthopedic, medicine and emergency-medicine unit admissions, respectively. Adverse events were identified from medical records using a pediatric trigger tool. All triggers identifying an adverse event related to drugs and drug-related devices were included. Data on drug use were extracted from the hospital drug-data warehouse. RESULTS: In total, 17794 daily drug orders were administrated to 486 (81.0% exposed) admissions. Parental nutrition, potassium salts and morphine constituted half of all high-risk drugs prescribed. Two-thirds of intravenous irritating drug doses consisted of vancomycin, esomeprazole and meropenem. In 129 (21.5%) admissions, at least one ADE was identified, out of which 21 ADE were classified as more severe (National Coordinating Council Medication Error Reporting Prevention-Index, NCCMERP=F). The ADE incidence was 47.4 (95% confidence interval: 39.4-57.3) per 1000 admission days and varied by unit category. In neonatal units, 56.9 (49.5-65.4) ADEs/1000 admission days were detected, in surgery/orthopedic 54.2 (40.3-72.8), in medicine 44.1 (33.1-58.7), and in emergency-medicine 14.3 (7.7-26.7) ADEs/1000 admission days were found. The most common types of ADEs were identified by triggers that were not directly aiming at drugs including insufficiently treated pain (incidence peaking already in the first days), skin, tissue or vascular harm (peaking at the end of the first week) and hospital-acquired infections (peaking in later admission days). CONCLUSION: Adverse drug events are common in pediatric patients.

However, it also shows that, in practice, views on co-creation and how to do it differ. This study aims to explore how patient innovators and researchers in a partnership research programme understand co-creation and how this understanding changes over time. METHODS: An explorative longitudinal qualitative study was conducted with the 'Patients in the Driver's Seat' partnership research programme. Fifty-eight interviews were performed and analysed using a reflexive thematic approach. FINDINGS: Four different ways of understanding co-creation were identified. These can be instrumentally conceptualized as themes using the inputs-process-outputs model: (1) combining different perspectives, experiences and backgrounds (inputs)", (2) deliberately dynamic and exploratory (process)," (3) striving for equity, not equality (process)"," and (4) diverse value creation, tangible and intangible (outputs). Together, these themes represent the varied understandings of co-creation among partnership programme members. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of patient innovators and researchers identified four distinct yet complementary understandings of co-creation. The study suggests that co-creation is the sum of its essential components, which can be divided into inputs, process, and outputs. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study, and the partnership programme it explored, aims to improve the relevance of research for patients and informal caregivers through an improved understanding of the concept of co-creation within research on patient innovation.

These so-called 'humanitarian drones' represent the first wave of robotics applied in the humanitarian and development contexts, providing critical information through mapping of crisis-affected areas and timely delivery of aid supplies to populations in need. Alongside these emergent uses of drones in the aid sector, debates have arisen about potential risks and challenges, presenting diverse perspectives on the ethical, legal, and social implications of humanitarian drones. Guided by the methodology introduced by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review offers an assessment of the ethical considerations discussed in the academic and gray literature based on a screening of 1,188 articles, from which we selected and analyzed 47 articles. In particular, we used a hybrid approach of qualitative content analysis, along with quantitative landscape mapping, to inductively develop a typology of ethical considerations associated with humanitarian drones. The results yielded 11 key areas of concern: (1) minimizing harm, (2) maximizing welfare, (3) substantive justice, (4) procedural justice, (5) respect for individuals, (6) respect for communities, (7) regulatory gaps, (8) regulatory dysfunction, (9) perceptions of humanitarian aid and organizations, (10) relations between humanitarian organizations and industry, and (11) the identity of humanitarian aid providers and organizations. Our findings illuminate topics that have been the focus of extensive attention (such as minimizing risks of harm and protecting privacy), traces the evolution of this discussion over time (i.e., an initial focus on mapping drones and the distinction of humanitarian from military use, toward the ethics of cargo drones carrying healthcare supplies and samples), and points to areas that have received less consideration (e.g., whether sustainability and shared benefits will be compromised if private companies' interest in humanitarian drones wanes once new markets open up). The review can thus help to situate and guide further analysis of drone use in humanitarian settings."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s11948-021-00327-4,Humans",*Organizations,Privacy,"*Robotics,34342721,PMC8330183",,,,,

To support Healthcare Workers (HCWs), a computerized decision support system (CDSS) was piloted at six rural maternal care units in Burkina Faso. During the two years of the study period, it was apparent from reports that the CDSS was not used regularly in clinical practice. This study aimed to explore the reasons why HCWs failed to use the CDSS. METHODS: A workshop, organized as group discussions and a plenary session, was performed with 13 participants to understand their experience with the CDSS and suggest improvements if pertinent. Workshop transcripts were analyzed thematically. Socio-demographic and usage patterns of the CDSS were examined by a questionnaire and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: The participants reported that the contextual basic conditions for using the CDSS were not fulfilled. These included unreliable power supply, none user-friendly partograph, the CDSS was not integrated with workflow and staff lacked motivational incentives. Despite these limitations, the HCWs reported learning benefits from guidance and alerts in the CDSS. Using the CDSS enabled them to discover problems earlier as they learned to focus on symptoms to prevent harmful situations. CONCLUSION: The CDSS was not tailored to the needs and context of the users. The HCWs, defined their needs and suggested how the CDSS should be re-designed. This suggests that the successful and regular usage of any CDSS in rural settings requires the involvement of users throughout the construction and pilot-testing phases and not only during the early prototype design period."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.5210/ojphi.v9i2.7905,"""",29026454,PMC5630276",,,,,,,,

Self-management programs have the potential to increase access and reduce costs related to exercise-based fall prevention. However, information regarding older people's views of participating in such programs is needed to support implementation. The aim of this study was to explore older people's experiences of a self-management fall prevention exercise routine guided either by a digital program (web-based or mobile) or a paper booklet. METHODS: This qualitative study was part of a feasibility study exploring two completely self-managed exercise interventions in which the participants tailored their own program, guided either by a digital program or a paper booklet. Individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of 28 participants (18 women), mean age 76 yrs. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Self-managing and self-tailoring these exercise programs was experienced as 'Managing pieces of a personal puzzle'. To independently being able to create a program and manage exercise was described in the categories 'Finding my own level' and 'Programming it into my life'. The participants experienced the flexibility and independence provided by completely self-managed exercise as positive and constructive although it required discipline. Furthermore, different needs and preferences when managing their exercise were described, as well as varying sources of motivation for doing the exercise, as highlighted in the category 'Defining my source of motivation'. The category 'Evolving my acquired knowledge' captures the participants' views of building their competence and strategies for maintenance of the exercise. It describes a combined process of learning the program and developing reflection, which was more clearly articulated by participants using the digital program. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new knowledge regarding experiences, preferences and motivations of older people to engage in home-based self-managed fall prevention exercise.

This research takes a first step in proposing several ways in which the blockchain technology can be used to improve current organizational practices, while also considering the ethical implications. Specifically, the paper examines the role that blockchain technology plays in three primary areas of people operations: (1) entry to the organization (via recruitment and selection), (2) intraorganizational processes (including compensation via smart contracts, retention and motivation via shared leadership and conflict management via network-based dispute resolution, and performance management), and (3) exit (offboarding). In each section, the paper reviews the ethical implications from the lenses of virtue ethics, utilitarianism, deontology and contractarianism. The paper concludes that in whole the implementation of blockchain technology in people operations processes can create a more ethical work environment.

Most studies require institutional review board (IRB) approval. Our objective is to identify predictors of delays or accelerations in the IRB review process and apply this knowledge to inform process change in an effort to improve IRB efficiency, transparency, consistency and communication. METHODS: We analyzed timelines of protocol submissions to determine protocol or IRB characteristics associated with different processing times. Our evaluation included single variable analysis to identify significant predictors of IRB processing time and machine learning methods to predict processing times through the IRB review system. Based on initial identified predictors, changes to IRB workflow and staffing procedures were instituted and we repeated our analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis identified several predictors of delays in the IRB review process including type of IRB review to be conducted, whether a protocol falls under Veteran's Administration purview and specific staff in charge of a protocol's review. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified several predictors of delays in IRB protocol review processing times using statistical and machine learning methods.

New behaviors and tasks emerged due to changes in roles, work processes, and responsibilities. This study investigates the effects of the digital transformation-in this case, how video visits in outpatient care change work processes and introduce new tasks-to further improve the concept of video visits. The overarching goal was to increase the value of these visits, with a focus on the value of conducting the treatment for the patient. OBJECTIVE: Through the real-time, social interactional features of preparing for and conducting video visits with patients with obesity, this study examines which patients the clinicians considered suitable for video visits and why. The aim was to identify the criteria used by clinicians when selecting patients for video visits to understand what criteria the clinicians used as the grounds for their selection. METHODS: Qualitative methods were used, including 13 observations of video visits at 2 different clinics and 14 follow-up interviews with clinicians. Transcripts of interviews and field notes were thematically analyzed, discussed, and synthesized into themes. RESULTS: From the interviews, 20 different arguments for selecting a specific patient for video visits were identified. Analyzing interviews and field notes also revealed unexpressed arguments that played a part in the selection process. The unexpressed arguments, as well as the implicit reasons, for why a patient was given the option of video visits can be understood as the selection criteria for helping clinicians in their decision about whether to offer video visits or not. The criteria identified in the collected data were divided into 3 themes: practicalities, patient ability, and meeting content. CONCLUSIONS: Not all patients with obesity undergoing treatment programs should be offered video visits. Patients' new responsibilities could influence the content of the meeting and the progress of the treatment program. The selection criteria developed and used by the clinicians could be a tool for finding a balance between what the patient wants and what the clinician thinks the patient can manage and achieving good results in the treatment program. The criteria could also reduce the number and severity of disturbances and limitations during the meeting and could be used to communicate the requirements they represent to the patient. Some of the criteria are based on facts, whereas others are subjective. A method for how and when to involve the patient in the selection process is recommended as it may strengthen the patient's sense of responsibility and the relationship with the clinician."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/jmir.9851,Ambulatory Care/*methods",Female,Humans,Male,Patient Selection,Qualitative Research,Telemedicine/*methods,"Videoconferencing/*standards,30401661,PMC6246961",

The series showcases the potential professional case managers have in support of managing during a crisis such as a global pandemic. Part II continues to describe reenvisioned roles and responsibilities of case managers and their leaders to meet the needs of patients/support systems during the crisis. It focuses on the increased need for end-of-life care, impact on workers' compensation case management practice, and the self-care needs of the professional case manager. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case management practice settings across the continuum of health and human services, with special focus on acute care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a crisis case managers and other health care professionals never faced something like it before. At the same time, it has provided opportunities for innovation and creativity including use of digital and telecommunication technology in new ways to ensure the continued delivery of health and human services to those who need them regardless of location. It has also resulted in the development of necessary and impactful partnerships within and across different health care organizations and diverse professional disciplines. Most importantly, this pandemic has required special attention to the increased need of patients for timely palliative and end-of-life care. In addition, it has prompted a focus on the safety, health, and well-being of case managers and other health care professionals, resulting in expanded workers' compensation case management practice coupled with the need for self-care and resilience. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers are integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles and responsibilities are even more necessary during the uncertainty of a global pandemic such as COVID-19. So far, the experience of this crisis has resulted in a deliberate need to ensure the safety of both, those who are the recipients of health care services and those who are responsible for the provision of care. Self-care and resilience of health care professionals and case managers, especially due to the complex dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, have advanced a desirable and necessary view of remote/virtual practice and as a strategy for enhancing the person's health and well-being. This pandemic has forced the development of impactful partnerships and collaborations among the diverse contexts of health care organizations and support service providers. These contexts of care delivery have also emphasized the necessary legal and ethical practice of case managers and the other involved parties. Experts agree that the innovative care delivery methods practiced during the pandemic will undoubtedly remain as desirable beyond the current crisis period."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1097/NCM.0000000000000455,""Betacoronavirus/*isolation & purification",COVID-19,*Case Management,Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*therapy/virology,Humans,Incidence,Pandemics,"Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/*therapy/virology",

Originally intended to address the problem of the overburdening of manual contract tracers, by the time the app was released six months later, the problem it sought to solve had drastically changed, without the solution undergoing any modification, making it a prime example of technosolutionism. While numerous critics have mobilised the concept of technosolutionism, the questions of how technosolutionism works in practice and which specific harms it can provoke have been understudied. In this paper we advance a thick conception of technosolutionism which, drawing on Evgeny Morozov, distinguishes it from the notion of technological fix, and, drawing on constructivism, emphasizes its constructivist dimension. Using this concept, we closely follow the problem that the Coronamelder aimed to solve and how it shifted over time to fit the Coronamelder solution, rather than the other way around. We argue that, although problems are always constructed, technosolutionist problems are badly constructed, insofar as the careful and cautious deliberation which should accompany problem construction in public policy is absent in the case of technosolutionism. This can lead to three harms: a subversion of democratic decision-making", the presence of powerful new actors in the public policy context - here Big Tech," and the creation of """"orphan problems"""", whereby the initial problems that triggered the need to develop a (techno)solution are left behind. We question whether the most popular form of technology ethics today, which focuses predominantly on the design of technology, is well-equipped to address these technosolutionist harms, insofar as such a focus may preclude critical thinking about whether or not technology should be the solution in the first place."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s13347-024-00807-y,"""",39479406,PMC11519188",,,,,,

While research has explored various aspects of this dilemma, little is known about how practitioners' outcome preferences influence their decisions in real-world scenarios. METHODS: This study employed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to investigate the relative importance of five outcomes (Relationship Quality, Satisfaction, Workload Strain, Value Conflict, and Reach) in fidelity-adaptation decisions among 209 practitioners delivering evidence-based parenting programs in Sweden. The DCE presented 25 choice sets across five contextual scenarios, analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression. RESULTS: All five outcomes significantly influenced practitioners' choices, with Relationship Quality emerging as the most impactful (log-odds: 4.56, 95% CI [4.16, 4.91]).

Electronic consent to collecting such data, however, poses new challenges when contrasted to traditional consent processes. It reduces the participant-researcher dialogue but provides an opportunity for the consent deliberation process to move from solitary to social settings. In this research, we propose that social annotations, embedded in the consent form, can help prospective participants deliberate on the research and the organization behind it in ways that traditional consent forms cannot. Furthermore, we examine the role of the comments' valence on prospective participants' beliefs and behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study focuses specifically on the influence of annotations' valence on participants' perceptions and behaviors surrounding online consent for biomedical research. We hope to shed light on how social annotation can be incorporated into digitally mediated consent forms responsibly and effectively. METHODS: In this controlled between-subjects experiment, participants were presented with an online consent form for a personal genomics study that contained social annotations embedded in its margins. Individuals were randomly assigned to view the consent form with positive-, negative-, or mixed-valence comments beside the text of the consent form. We compared participants' perceptions of being informed and having understood the material, their trust in the organization seeking the consent, and their actual consent across conditions. RESULTS: We find that comment valence has a marginally significant main effect on participants' perception of being informed (F2=2.40, P=.07)"," specifically, participants in the positive condition (mean 4.17, SD 0.94) felt less informed than those in the mixed condition (mean 4.50, SD 0.69, P=.09). Comment valence also had a marginal main effect on the extent to which participants reported trusting the organization (F2=2.566, P=.08). Participants in the negative condition (mean 3.59, SD 1.14) were marginally less trusting than participants exposed to the positive condition (mean 4.02, SD 0.90, P=.06). Finally, we found that consent rate did not differ across comment valence conditions"," however, participants who spent less time studying the consent form were more likely to consent when they were exposed to positive-valence comments. CONCLUSIONS: This work explores the effects of adding a computer-mediated social dimension, which inherently contains human emotions and opinions, to the consent deliberation process. We proposed that augmenting the consent deliberation process to incorporate multiple voices can enable individuals to capitalize on the knowledge of others, which brings to light questions, problems, and concerns they may not have considered on their own. We found that consent forms containing positive valence annotations are likely to lead participants to feel less informed and simultaneously more trusting of the organization seeking consent. In certain cases where participants spent little time considering the content of the consent form, participants exposed to positive valence annotations were even more likely to consent to the study. We suggest that these findings represent important considerations for the design of future electronic informed consent mechanisms."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/jmir.5662,Adult",*Consent Forms,Female,*Health Behavior,Humans,*Informed Consent,

As digital natives, we recognize that electronic devices can generate both beneficial and harmful outcomes for developing children in this digital age. Globally, pediatric exposure to digital screens continues to increase and is associated with undesirable effects on childhood development, particularly language skills. This study explores the influence of the quantity and quality of screen media use on the development of language skills in children aged one to four years residing in Dubai and the Northern Emirates, while also considering other factors that may contribute to speech delays. Aim This study aims to investigate the association between prolonged screen time and speech delay in children aged one to four years living in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. Additionally, it examines the relationship between parents' screen time and their child's screen time and speech delay, as well as the effect of multiple languages spoken at home on the child's speech development. Methods A cross-sectional, online-based anonymous questionnaire was conducted with the guardians of children aged one to four years from Dubai and the Northern Emirates. A total of 192 entries were collected after applying exclusion criteria. The study focused on the amount of screen time, the type of content viewed by children on various electronic devices, and its effect on speech development. Other contributing factors, including the number of languages spoken, gender, number of siblings, parents' work status, and parent-child interactions, were also examined. Results The study revealed that 25.5% (49 of 192 participants) had speech delays. Speech delay was most prevalent among one-year-olds, with 44.9% (22 out of 55) affected, and it was more common in males, affecting 32.7% (34 out of 104) compared to females (17%, 15 out of 88). Children who spoke more than one language had a lower prevalence of speech delay, with no delays observed in children who spoke three or more languages, and only 11.8% (10 out of 85) in those who spoke two languages. Increased screen time was linked to a higher prevalence of speech delay, with 40% (6 out of 15) of children with more than four hours of screen time affected. Conclusion The findings suggest that the amount of screen time is a critical factor in speech delays among young children. Prolonged screen time, particularly over four hours per day, was associated with a higher risk of speech delay. Further research is needed to explore the causal mechanisms and other contributing factors, such as parent-child interactions and socioeconomic status, that may influence speech development."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.73488,"""",39669810,PMC11635129",,,,,,,,

Despite this, they generally lack training in implementation. In clinical settings, implementation is often a team effort, so it calls for team training. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the Building Implementation Capacity (BIC) intervention that targets teams of professionals, including their managers. METHODS: A non-randomized design was used, with two intervention cases (each consisting of two groups). The longitudinal, mixed-methods evaluation included pre-post and workshop-evaluation questionnaires, and interviews following Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation framework. The intervention was delivered in five workshops, using a systematic implementation method with exercises and practical working materials. To improve transfer of training, the teams' managers were included. Practical experiences were combined with theoretical knowledge, social interactions, reflections, and peer support. RESULTS: Overall, the participants were satisfied with the intervention (first level), and all groups increased their self-rated implementation knowledge (second level). The qualitative results indicated that most participants applied what they had learned by enacting new implementation behaviors (third level). However, they only partially applied the implementation method, as they did not use the planned systematic approach. A few changes in organizational results occurred (fourth level). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention had positive effects with regard to the first two levels of the evaluation model"," that is, the participants were satisfied with the intervention and improved their knowledge and skills. Some positive changes also occurred on the third level (behaviors) and fourth level (organizational results), but these were not as clear as the results for the first two levels. This highlights the fact that further optimization is needed to improve transfer of training when building teams' implementation capacity. In addition to considering the design of such interventions, the organizational context and the participants' characteristics may also need to be considered to maximize the chances that the learned skills will be successfully transferred to behaviors."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12913-019-4086-1,""*Capacity Building",Group Processes,"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice",Humans,Patient Care Team/*organization & administration,Personal Satisfaction,"Practice Management, Medical",

Despite current efforts, the exclusive breastfeeding rate (EBF) for children under six months is only 24%. Intention to breastfeed is a strong predictor for long-term breastfeeding, however, little is known about pregnant women's breastfeeding intentions in Myanmar. We, therefore, aimed to identify the factors associated with women's intention to EBF. METHOD: Data in this article was collected in a baseline survey for a randomized controlled trial, which aimed to assess the impact of mobile text messages on the breastfeeding practices of women in Yangon, Myanmar. A total of 353 pregnant women at 28-34 weeks of gestation, recruited into the trial from the antenatal clinics of the Central Women's Hospital, Yangon, Myanmar, responded to the baseline survey questions, which included background information and breastfeeding related characteristics. To determine factors associated with women's intention to EBF logistic regression was used to analyse individual demographic, household economic and breastfeeding characteristics. In-depth interviews were performed with a sub-sample of 24 women who participated in the survey, to gain a further understanding of these associated factors. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, working women were less likely to intend to EBF (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.30, CI 0.17-0.53). Women from rich households (AOR = 2.43, CI 1.08-5.47) and middle income households (AOR = 1.79, CI 1.01-3.16)"," those who had high (AOR = 10.19, CI 3.43-30.23) and medium (AOR = 5.46, CI 1.79-16.72) breastfeeding knowledge levels, and received information from health professionals (AOR = 2.29, CI 1.29-4.03) and mobile internet (AOR 3.62, CI 2.04-6.41) had a higher intention to EBF. These findings were supported by qualitative analysis, which revealed that returning to work was the main barrier", health staff and printed media are reliable sources and," women with higher knowledge had high intentions to EBF. CONCLUSIONS: EBF intention was influenced by many factors. Breastfeeding promotion programs should target the poor, working women and women with lower breastfeeding knowledge. Breastfeeding education via health staff and the Internet, breastfeeding facilities at the work place and longer maternity leave in the private sector should all be encouraged.

There is little guidance, however, on how to best report findings from studies leveraging those data. Thus, there is a need to characterize current reporting practices so as to better understand the potential implications for producing reproducible results. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this scoping review was to characterize publications' reporting practices for research that collects PGHD using mobile devices. METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed and screened the results. Qualifying publications were classified according to 6 dimensions-1 covering key bibliographic details (for all articles) and 5 covering reporting criteria considered necessary for reproducible and responsible research (ie, """"participant,"""" """"data,"""" """"device,"""" """"study,"""" and """"ethics,"""" for original research). For each of the 5 reporting dimensions, we also assessed reporting completeness. RESULTS: Out of 3602 publications screened, 100 were included in this review. We observed a rapid increase in all publications from 2016 to 2021, with the largest contribution from US authors, with 1 exception, review articles. Few original research publications used crowdsourcing platforms (7%, 3/45). Among the original research publications that reported device ownership, most (75%, 21/28) reported using participant-owned devices for data collection (ie, a Bring-Your-Own-Device [BYOD] strategy). A significant deficiency in reporting completeness was observed for the """"data"""" and """"ethics"""" dimensions (5 reporting factors were missing in over half of the research publications). Reporting completeness for data ownership and participants' access to data after contribution worsened over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our work depicts the reporting practices in publications about research involving PGHD from mobile devices. We found that very few papers reported crowdsourcing platforms for data collection. BYOD strategies are increasingly popular"," this creates an opportunity for improved mechanisms to transfer data from device owners to researchers on crowdsourcing platforms. Given substantial reporting deficiencies, we recommend reaching a consensus on best practices for research collecting PGHD from mobile devices. Drawing from the 5 reporting dimensions in this scoping review, we share our recommendations and justifications for 9 items. These items require improved reporting to enhance data representativeness and quality and empower participants."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/51955,Humans","*Patient Generated Health Data,39832140,PMC11791458",,,,,,

This study aimed to explore the associations of workforce participation with depression among US older adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018. Depression was measured with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9). Workforce participation was measured with work status, work types, shift work, and hours worked per week. Multivariate generalised linear and logistic regression models, also with restricted cubic spline (RCS) were performed to examine linear or non-linear associations between workforce participation and depression.

D4DS principles and methods are not well-known or used during clinical and public health research", research teams would benefit from applying D4DS. This paper presents the development of a new digital platform for research teams to learn and apply a D4DS process to their work. METHODS: A user-centered design (UCD) approach engaged users (n = 14) and an expert panel (n = 6) in an iterative design process from discovery to prototyping and testing. We led five design sessions using Zoom and Figma software over a 5-month period. Users (71% academics," 29% practitioners) participated in at least 2 sessions. Following design sessions, feedback from users was summarized and discussed to generate design decisions. A prototype was then built and heuristically tested with 11 users who were asked to complete multiple tasks within the platform while verbalizing their decision-making using the 'think aloud' procedure. The System Usability Scale (SUS) was administered at the end of each testing session. After refinements to the platform were made, usability was reassessed with 7 of 11 same users to examine changes. RESULTS: The interactive digital platform (the D4DS Planner) has two main components: 1) the Education Hub (e.g., searchable platform with literature, videos, websites) and 2) the Action Planner. The Action Planner includes 7 interactive steps that walk users through a set of activities to generate a downloadable D4DS action plan for their project. Participants reported that the prototype tool was moderately usable (SUS = 66) but improved following refinements (SUS = 71). CONCLUSIONS: This is a first of its kind tool that supports research teams in learning about and explicitly applying D4DS to their work. The use of this publicly available tool may increase the adoption, impact, and sustainment of a wide range of research products. The use of UCD yielded a tool that is easy to use. This tool's future use and impact will be evaluated with a broader sample of community partners and projects and the tool will continue to be refined and improved."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13012-024-01410-7,Humans",*User-Centered Design,*Information Dissemination/methods,Female,Software,Male,

This study aimed to identify previous participation in and preferences for CSHC as well as associated sociodemographic and attitudinal factors among the general public in Germany. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a population-based online panel in five German federal states (04-06/2022). We performed descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analysis to assess prior participation in CSHC and content preferences regarding CSHC, as well as associations between sociodemographic variables and general preference for CSHC. RESULTS: Among 1491 participants (response rate 47.1%), 8.7% explicitly reported having participated in CSHC, while 39.9% had discussed at least one CSHC-related topic with physicians.

However, such a common language is lacking for obesity. Therefore, the European Association for the Study of Obesity undertook a taxonomy initiative to provide standardised language for obesity as commonly used from policy to practice for other major policy-prioritised non-communicable diseases (NCDs). METHODS: An online Delphi consensus study was conducted, involving a panel of experts representing stakeholder groups of policymakers, healthcare professionals, people with lived experience, and researchers. Based on the understanding of obesity as an adiposity-based chronic disease, 54 statements demarcated into definition, scope and contextual usage were developed across six themes: Definition of obesity, Causes, onset and progression, Obesity prevention, Screening and early diagnosis, Treatment and management, Obesity consequences. RESULTS: Of the 194 invited experts, 70 (36%), 63 (33%), and 58 (30%) experts participated in rounds one, two, and three, respectively. Consensus was achieved on 70% of the proposed definitions, scope, and contextual usage after round one, 94% after round two and 100% after round three. The Definition of Obesity theme included distinctions between population-level indicators and individual-level signs of obesity, and how pre-obesity was defined. The Causes, Onset and Progression theme characterised the timing of obesity development. The Obesity Prevention theme explicitly differentiated between health promotion and primary prevention. Both the Screening and Early Diagnosis, and the Treatment and Management themes defined concepts supporting a continuum of care model. The Consequences of Obesity theme encompassed health and socio-economic outcomes. CONCLUSION: The taxonomy provides a contemporary evidence-based language about obesity that aligns with language used for policy-prioritised NCDs. The taxonomy is useful for education, advocacy, and communication and can be used by policymakers, healthcare professionals, people living with obesity, researchers, and health system users."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1038/s41366-024-01565-9,Humans",*Obesity/epidemiology,*Delphi Technique,Europe/epidemiology,Consensus,Terminology as Topic,"Language,38902385,PMC11805702",,

The vast majority of students thought that when AI is used in medicine that it is important that there are legal rules regarding liability (97%) and oversight mechanisms (93.7%), that physicians should be consulted prior to implementation (96.8%), that developers should be able to explain to them the details of the algorithm (95.6%), that algorithms should use representative data (93.9%), and that patients should always be informed when AI is used (93.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Medical schools and continuing medical education organisers need to promptly develop programs to ensure that clinicians are able to fully realize the potential of AI technology. It is also important that legal rules and oversight are implemented to ensure that future clinicians are not faced with a workplace where important issues around responsibility are not clearly regulated."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pdig.0000114,"""",36812635,PMC9931368",,,,,,,,

Rare-disease policy, specifically research priority setting for the allocation of limited research resources, is an area where evidence generation through stakeholder involvement is expected to be effective. We generated evidence for rare-disease policymaking through stakeholder involvement and explored effective collaboration among stakeholders. METHODS: We constructed a space called 'Evidence-generating Commons', where patients, family members, researchers, and former policymakers can share their knowledge and experiences and engage in continual deliberations on evidence generation. Ten rare diseases were consequently represented. In the 'Commons', 25 consecutive workshops were held predominantly online, from 2019 to 2021. These workshops focused on (1) clarification of difficulties faced by rare-disease patients, (2) development and selection of criteria for priority setting, and (3) priority setting through the application of the criteria. For the first step, an on-site workshop using sticky notes was held. The data were analysed based on KJ method. For the second and third steps, workshops on specific themes were held to build consensus. The workshop agendas and methods were modified based on participants' feedback. RESULTS: The 'Commons' was established with 43 participants, resulting in positive effects such as capacity building, opportunities for interactions, mutual understanding, and empathy among the participants. The difficulties faced by patients with rare diseases were classified into 10 categories. Seven research topics were identified as priority issues to be addressed including 'impediments to daily life', 'financial burden', 'anxiety', and 'burden of hospital visits'. This was performed by synthesising the results of the application of the two criteria that were particularly important to strengthen future research on rare diseases. We also clarified high-priority research topics by using criteria valued more by patients and family members than by researchers and former policymakers, and criteria with specific perspectives. CONCLUSION: We generated evidence for policymaking in the field of rare diseases. This study's insights into stakeholder involvement can enhance evidence-informed policymaking. We engaged in comprehensive discussions with policymakers regarding policy implementation and planned analysis of the participants' experiences in this project."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40900-023-00515-5,"""",38031179,PMC10685685",,,,,,,,

There is a need for evidence on the quality of fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) fabricated using either digital or conventional impressions. This study aimed to evaluate the marginal fit of single-crown and three-unit FDP frameworks fabricated from digital and conventional impressions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Crown preparations were made on a maxillary typodont model (KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach, Germany) on the right central incisor for a single-crown framework and the right first premolar and first molar for a three-unit framework to replace the second premolar. Four scanners (Dental Wings (DW, Straumann Group, Montreal, Canada), Carestream 3600 (CS, Carestream Dental, Atlanta, GA, USA), Medit i700 (M700, MEDIT Corp., Seoul, Republic of Korea), and Medit i500 (M500, MEDIT Corp.)) were used to record digital impressions of the preparations. Conventional impressions using polyether monophase impression material were also made, and stone casts were fabricated using high-strength stone and scanned using a laboratory scanner (Dental Wings, Straumann Group). Stereolithography files and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) were used to produce 50 zirconia FDPs (25 each of single crowns and three-unit frameworks). The marginal fit of the prostheses was determined by marginal gap measurements while seated on the typodont, a gap of =150µm being deemed acceptable. Results were summarized as means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges (IQRs). The independent t-test and one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for means and Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post hoc test for medians were performed for hypothesis testing at a<0.05. RESULTS: The respective marginal gap measurements for single-crown and three-unit FDPs were 151.3±60.1µm and 153.9±50.1µm (polyether), 185.0±63.7µm and 224.2±81.7µm (DW), 177.1±81.3µm and 146.4±44.9µm (CS), 158.0±48.7µm and 184.3±86.2µm (M700), and 195.9±61.7µm and 202.8±71.1µm (M500). The marginal gap measurements of single crowns were significantly different among the five impression methods (F = 2.54, p = 0.042"," ?(2) = 14.68, p = 0.005) but not among the four digital methods (F = 1.83, p = 0.146), with the specific differences being between polyether and DW (p<0.01) and between polyether and M500 (p<0.001). The marginal gap measurements of the three-unit prostheses were significantly different among all five impression methods (F = 13.52, ?(2) = 46.64, p<0.001) and the four digital methods (F = 12.32, p<0.001).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of gamification features in a mHealth app that includes the most common categories of behavior change techniques for the self-report of lifestyle data. The data reported by the user can be manual (i.e., diet, activity, and weight) and automatic (Fitbit wearable devices). As a secondary objective, this work aims to explore the differences in the adherence when considering a longer study duration and make a comparative analysis of the gamification effect. METHODS: In this study, the effectiveness of various behavior change techniques strategies is evaluated through the analysis of two user groups. With a first group of users, we perform a comparative analysis in terms of adherence and system usability scale of two versions of the app, both including the most common categories of behavior change techniques but the second version having added gamification features. Then, with a second group of participants and the best mHealth app version, a longer study is carried out and user adherence, the system usability scale and user feedback are analyzed. RESULTS: In the first stage study, results have shown that the app version with gamification features has achieved a higher adherence, as the percentage of days active was higher for most of the users and the system usability scale score is 80.67, which is categorized as rank A. The app also exceeded the expectations of the users by about 70% for the app version with gamification functionalities. In the second stage of the study, an adherence of 76.25% is reported after 8 weeks and 58% at the end of the pilot for the mHealth app. Similarly, for the wearable device, an adherence of 74.32% is achieved after 8 weeks and 81.08% is obtained at the end of the pilot. We hypothesize that these specific wearable devices have contributed to a decreased system usability scale score, reaching 62.89 which is ranked as C. CONCLUSION: This study evidences the effectiveness of the gamification category of behavior change techniques in increasing the overall user adherence, expectations, and perceived usability. In addition, the results provide quantitative results on the effect of the most common categories of behavior change techniques for the self-report of lifestyle data. Therefore, a higher duration in the study has shown several limitations when capturing lifestyle data, especially when including wearable devices such as Fitbit."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-024-02833-4,Humans",*Telemedicine,*Mobile Applications,Male,Adult,Female,Self Report,Middle Aged,

However, despite the abundance of feature selection (FS) methods available, challenges remain in choosing the most appropriate method, deciding how many top-ranked variables to include, and ensuring these selections are meaningful from a medical perspective. METHODS: We developed a practical multi-step feature selection (FS) framework that integrates data-driven statistical inference with a knowledge verification strategy. This framework was validated using two distinct EMR datasets targeting different clinical outcomes. The first cohort, sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III), focused on predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients. The second cohort, drawn from the MIMIC-IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED), aimed to estimate in-hospital mortality (IHM) for patients transferred from the ED to the ICU. We employed various machine learning (ML) methods and conducted a comparative analysis considering accuracy, stability, similarity, and interpretability. The effectiveness of our FS framework was evaluated using discrimination and calibration metrics, with SHAP applied to enhance the interpretability of model decisions. RESULTS: Cohort 1 comprised 48,780 ICU encounters, of which 8,883 (18.21%) developed AKI. Cohort 2 included 29,197 transfers from the ED to the ICU, with 3,219 (11.03%) resulting in IHM. Among the ten ML methods evaluated, the tree-based ensemble method achieved the highest accuracy. As the number of top-ranking features increased, the models' accuracy began to stabilize, while feature subset stability (considering sample variations) and inter-method feature similarity reached optimal levels, confirming the validity of the FS framework. The integration of interpretative methods and expert knowledge in the final step further improved feature interpretability. The FS framework effectively reduced the number of features (e.g., from 380 to 35 for Cohort 1, and from 273 to 54 for Cohort 2) without significantly affecting prediction performance (Delong test, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The multi-step FS method developed in this study successfully reduces the dimensionality of features in EMR while preserving the accuracy of clinical outcome prediction. Furthermore, it improves the interpretability of risk factors by incorporating expert knowledge validation."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-025-02922-y,""Humans",*Electronic Health Records,*Hospital Mortality,*Machine Learning,Acute Kidney Injury,Intensive Care Units,"Emergency Service, Hospital","Outcome Assessment, Health Care/standards"",39962480,PMC11834488",

On the functional dimension, metaproteomics data can be used to quantify beta-diversity to understand how microbial community functional profiles vary under different environmental conditions. Conventional approaches to metaproteomic functional beta-diversity often treat protein functions as independent features, ignoring the evolutionary relationships among microbial taxa from which different proteins originate. A more informative functional distance metric that incorporates evolutionary relatedness is needed to better understand microbiome functional dissimilarities. RESULTS: Here, we introduce PhyloFunc, a novel functional beta-diversity metric that incorporates microbiome phylogeny to inform on metaproteomic functional distance. Leveraging the phylogenetic framework of weighted UniFrac distance, PhyloFunc innovatively utilizes branch lengths to weigh between-sample functional distances for each taxon, rather than differences in taxonomic abundance as in weighted UniFrac. Proof of concept using a simulated toy dataset and a real dataset from mouse inoculated with a synthetic gut microbiome and fed different diets show that PhyloFunc successfully captured functional compensatory effects between phylogenetically related taxa. We further tested a third dataset of complex human gut microbiomes treated with five different drugs to compare PhyloFunc's performance with other traditional distance methods. PCoA and machine learning-based classification algorithms revealed higher sensitivity of PhyloFunc in microbiome responses to paracetamol. We provide PhyloFunc as an open-source Python package (available at https://pypi.org/project/phylofunc/ ), enabling efficient calculation of functional beta-diversity distances between a pair of samples or the generation of a distance matrix for all samples within a dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike traditional approaches that consider metaproteomics features as independent and unrelated, PhyloFunc acknowledges the role of phylogenetic context in shaping the functional landscape in metaproteomes. In particular, we report that PhyloFunc accounts for the functional compensatory effect of taxonomically related species. Its effectiveness, ecological relevance, and enhanced sensitivity in distinguishing group variations are demonstrated through the specific applications presented in this study.

This exploratory study examines common practices in the planning and coordination of post-trial access to neurosurgical devices. We also explore the perspectives of trial investigators on the barriers to post-trial access and ongoing care, as well as ethical questions related to the responsibilities of key stakeholder groups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Trial investigators (n=66) completed a survey on post-trial access in the most recent investigational trial of a surgically implanted neural device they had conducted. Survey respondents predominantly specialized in neurosurgery, neurology and psychiatry, with a mean of 14.8 years of experience working with implantable neural devices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of interest included rates of device explantation during or at the conclusion of the trial (pre-follow-up) and whether plans for post-trial access were described in the study protocol. Outcomes also included investigators' greatest 'barrier' and 'facilitator' to providing research participants with post-trial access to functional implants and perspectives on current arrangements for the sharing of post-trial responsibilities among key stakeholders. RESULTS: Trial investigators reported either 'all' (64%) or 'most' (33%) trial participants had remained implanted after the end of the trial, with 'infection' and 'non-response' the most common reasons for explantation. When asked to describe the main barriers to facilitating post-trial access, investigators described limited funding, scarcity of expertise and specialist clinical infrastructure and difficulties maintaining stakeholder relationships. Notwithstanding these barriers, investigators overwhelmingly (95%) agreed there is an ethical obligation to provide post-trial access when participants individually benefit during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: On occasions when devices were explanted during or at the end of the trial, this was done out of concern for the safety and well-being of participants. Further research into common practices in the post-trial phase is needed and essential to ethical and pragmatic discussions regarding stakeholder responsibilities."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1136/bmjsit-2024-000262,"""",38646454,PMC11029395",,,,,,,,

However, less than 10% of babies born every year have been screened for hearing loss. The Hearing for Life (HeLe) research program aims to increase the rate of newborn hearing screening (NHS) nationwide through the development and deployment of novel digital health or eHealth technologies in government rural primary care health centers (PCHC). The HeLe is also built on the global call for increased and systematic use of eHealth to strengthen health systems. Effectiveness of eHealth innovations requires acknowledgment of the product's life cycle", one consideration is organizational readiness at this development stage of the HeLe. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed readiness of the eight PCHC selected to use the HeLe technologies. METHODS: This research utilized the Khoja-Durrani-Scott (KDS) eHealth evaluation tool to assess the PCHC's readiness level prior to the implementation of HeLe. The KDS tool was distributed through a self-administered survey," data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Readiness is measured in terms of seven dimensions or outcomes resulting from the use of the HeLe technologies. RESULTS: The study revealed that the eight PCHC were most to least ready, in decreasing order, in the following areas: Ethical, Health, Technology, Social & Cultural, Readiness & Change Management, as well as Economic, and Policy outcomes. The study affirms the PCHCs' value for equity in health care, i.e., providing accessible NHS services in the community setting closest to where the families and their newborns are. Likewise, results confirm the PCHC staff's preparedness for another set of innovations, through agreement with statements on Technology, Social & Cultural as well as Readiness & Change Management parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The results informed the training and technical support strategies to be implemented by the HeLe program proponents. However, even in this early development phase of the HeLe technologies, the PCHC are already concerned with how to sustain NHS services after the research. Fully aware that the HeLe ICT tools need to be maintained and upgraded, the PCHC views that economic and policy support should also be in place to ensure continuous delivery of the ICT-enabled NHS services. While results are illustrative, usefulness is limited by the small sample size and character of the study sites. Nevertheless, social dimensions still have to be carefully considered as innovative NHS tools are introduced to primary care health workers nationwide. Researchers have to be deliberate in working with broader health systems and policy advocacy efforts to allow novel NHS technologies to be smoothly introduced at the community level and frontlines of care."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.47895/amp.v57i9.4984,"""",39483796,PMC11522616",,,,,,

This may cause limited access to examination slots because of the growing demand for PSMA-PET. Ultra-fast PSMA-PET may enhance throughput but comes at the cost of poor image quality. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the accuracy of AI-enhanced ultra-fast PSMA-PET for staging of patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: A total number of 357 whole-body [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET datasets were included. Patients underwent two digital PET scans, one at standard and one at ultra-fast speed (table speed: 0.6-1.2 mm/s vs. 50 mm/s). A modified pix2pixHD generative adversarial network to enhance the ultra-fast images was trained with 286 datasets and evaluated with the remaining 71 datasets. The staging accuracy of ultra-fast PSMA-PET and AI-enhanced ultra-fast PET was compared with the reference standard PET separately for miTNM regions proposed by PROMISE V2.0. RESULTS: The AI-network significantly improved the visual image quality and detection rate in most miTNM regions compared with the non-enhanced image data (T: 69.6% vs. 43.5%, p < 0.05"," N: 46.3% vs. 27.8%, p < 0.01"," M1a 64.4% vs. 47.5%, p < 0.01"," M1b: 85.7% vs. 72.1%, p < 0.01). However, improvement was not significant for the M1c category (42.9 vs. 28.6%, p > 0.05). Missed lesions had a smaller SUVmax and lesion size compared with detected lesions (exemplary for N: 9.5 vs. 26.5 SUVmax"," 4 vs. 10 mm). SUVmax values of lesions were significantly different in all miTNM regions between the ultra-fast and reference standard PET, but only in the T-region between the AI-enhanced and reference standard PET. CONCLUSION: The AI-based image enhancement improved image quality and region detection rates by a mean of 17.9%. As the sensitivity of synthetic PET for small and low-uptake lesions was limited, a potential clinical use case could be disease monitoring in patients with high tumor volume and PSMA uptake undergoing PSMA radioligand therapy. The improvement in detection rate of distant metastases was not significant. This indicates that more training data is needed to ensure robust results also for lesions that have lower appearance frequency. Future studies on accelerated PSMA-PET seem warranted."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1007/s00259-024-07060-7,""Humans",Male,*Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology,*Neoplasm Staging,

EMS provides valuable learning opportunities for nursing students, fostering person-centered care approaches and a variation of clinical training and learning. Formative feedback is crucial to develop knowledge and skills. Multisource feedback (MSF) offers a comprehensive assessment by incorporating feedback from various individuals, promoting self-reflection and targeted learning. MSF has not, to our knowledge, been systematically evaluated in the context of EMS, and therefore, the aim of the study was to describe nursing students' experiences with MSF during their clinical education in the EMS, using a digital instrument as a facilitating tool. METHODS: A qualitative design with an inductive approach was used. Data were collected in 2021, using focus group interviews (n = 4) with 31 final-semester nursing students in Stockholm, Sweden, who had conducted clinical education in the EMS and received MSF through a digital instrument. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke's methodology. RESULTS: Three themes revealed: feedback from sources familiar with the student's learning objectives, feedback from sources unfamiliar with the learning objectives, and general perceptions of MSF in the EMS. Students valued self-reflection and feedback from peers and supervisors for personal and professional growth. Patient feedback was challenging due to their limited contextual understanding and emotional states, while feedback from other healthcare professionals was appreciated but hindered by the healthcare professionals' workload and timing constraints. Overall, students appreciated MSF's diverse perspectives, enriching their learning, performance, and development. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the value of MSF in nursing students' clinical education within the EMS. Feedback from peers, supervisors, and self-reflection enhances self-awareness, professional growth, and mutual support. Despite challenges like stress and logistical barriers, structured support and a digital instrument improved accessibility and alignment with learning objectives for the students. Incorporating patient and healthcare professionals' feedback enriches education by promoting patient-centred care and collaboration.

Smartphone cameras are useful for shade matching. Currently, no study has directly compared the accuracy of this method. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of the visual method, smartphone photography, and the Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer, particularly for chroma, value, and hue. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved a convenient sample of 82 dental students from the College of Dental Medicine at Umm Al-Qura University, including those in their 5(th), 6(th), and 7(th) (intern) years. The VITA classical shade guide was utilized to compare three methods of shade selection: the conventional visual method, smartphone photography, and the Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer. The percentage accuracy for each method was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI), using the visual method as the reference standard. Statistical comparisons of the shade selection methods, as well as gender differences, were performed using a Chi-Square test. Fisher's exact test was applied where expected cell counts were below five. Stata software was used with a significance threshold of 0.05. RESULTS: The current study included 82 subjects"," 42 were females and 40 were males. There was no significant difference between male and female students in the measured accuracy by using the three methods except for hue when the photo method was used (p=0.015). For chroma (p=0.094), value (p=0.965), and hue (p=0.094), the photo method was comparable in accuracy to the visual method. The accuracy was slightly higher for the photo method, but this difference was not statistically significant. The Easyshade was also comparable to the visual method in chroma (p=0.674), significantly lower when assessing value (p=0.002) and not statistically lower when assessing hue (p=0.094). Comparing the results of the same method, the accuracy of shade selection was highest for chroma, followed by value, and lowest for hue. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, digital photography using a smartphone camera may serve as a reliable method for clinicians in shade selection during clinical practice."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.73338,"""",39659333,PMC11629710",,,,,,,

Anomaly in electronic health record can be associated with an insider trying to access and manipulate the data. This article focuses around the anomalies under different contexts. METHODOLOGY: This research has proposed methodology to secure Electronic Health Records (EHRs) within a complex environment. We have employed a systematic approach encompassing data preprocessing, labeling, modeling, and evaluation. Anomalies are not labelled thus a mechanism is required that predicts them with greater accuracy and less false positive results. This research utilized unsupervised machine learning algorithms that includes Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor clustering algorithms. By calculating anomaly scores and validating clustering through metrics like the Silhouette Score and Dunn Score, we enhanced the capacity to secure sensitive healthcare data evolving digital threats. Three variations of Isolation Forest (IForest)models (SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) and three variations of Local Outlier Factor (LOF) models (SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) are evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 Score. RESULTS: Isolation Forest SVM achieves the highest accuracy of 99.21%, high sensitivity (99.75%) and specificity (99.32%), and a commendable F1 Score of 98.72%. The Isolation Forest Decision Tree also performs well with an accuracy of 98.92% and an F1 Score of 99.35%. However, the Isolation Forest Random Forest exhibits lower specificity (72.84%) than the other models. CONCLUSION: The experimental results reveal that Isolation Forest SVM emerges as the top performer showcasing the effectiveness of these models in anomaly detection tasks. The proposed methodology utilizing isolation forest and SVM produced better results by detecting anomalies with less false positives in this specific EHR of a hospital in North England. Furthermore the proposal is also able to identify new contextual anomalies that were not identified in the baseline methodology."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12911-024-02760-4,Humans",*Machine Learning,*Electronic Health Records,Computer Security,Unsupervised Machine Learning,"Support Vector Machine,39563355,PMC11577804",,,

We tested whether messages describing how a COVID-19 digital contact-tracing app protects users' privacy led to increased or decreased intentions to download the app by either calming privacy concerns or increasing their saliency. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We recruited adult smartphone owners in the U.S. (oversampled for younger adults aged 18-34 years) in November 2020 through an online panel. INTERVENTION: Survey software randomly assigned 860 participants to 1 of 2 parallel messaging conditions (n=430 privacy assured, n=430 no privacy described). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 4-point scale of intention to use the app """"if public health officials released a COVID Exposure Notification app in their state"""" that averaged likelihood to (1) download and install the app on their phone", (2) keep the app active on their phone," and (3) keep Bluetooth active on their phone (needed for the app to work). RESULTS: After removing incompletes, those who failed the manipulation checks, or those who had already downloaded a COVID-19 digital contact-tracing app, we analyzed 671 participants (n=330 privacy, n=341 no privacy) in 2021. There was no relationship between privacy condition and download intention (mean(privacy)=2.69, mean(noprivacy)=2.69, b=0.01, 95% CI= -0.13, 0.15, p=0.922) but also no evidence that describing the app's security increased context-dependent privacy concerns (measured 3 ways). Instead, we found increased endorsement of data security in the privacy condition using a scale of beliefs about the app keeping privacy secure (mean(privacy)=2.74, mean(noprivacy)=2.58, b=0.16, 95% CI=0.04, 0.28, p=0.009, small effect ?(2)=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some evidence that people developing contact-tracing messaging campaigns do not need to worry that describing a digital contact-tracing app's privacy protections will backfire.

However, evaluation of the PRS(313) across different European populations which could influence risk estimation has not been performed. METHODS: We explored the distribution of PRS(313) across European populations using genotype data from 94,072 females without breast cancer diagnosis, of European-ancestry from 21 countries participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and 223,316 females without breast cancer diagnosis from the UK Biobank. The mean PRS was calculated by country in the BCAC dataset and by country of birth in the UK Biobank. We explored different approaches to reduce the observed heterogeneity in the mean PRS across the countries, and investigated the implications of the distribution variability in risk prediction. RESULTS: The mean PRS(313) differed markedly across European countries, being highest in individuals from Greece and Italy and lowest in individuals from Ireland. Using the overall European PRS(313) distribution to define risk categories, leads to overestimation and underestimation of risk in some individuals from these countries. Adjustment for principal components explained most of the observed heterogeneity in the mean PRS. The mean estimates derived when using an empirical Bayes approach were similar to the predicted means after principal component adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that PRS distribution differs even within European ancestry populations leading to underestimation or overestimation of risk in specific European countries, which could potentially influence clinical management of some individuals if is not appropriately accounted for. Population-specific PRS distributions may be used in breast cancer risk estimation to ensure predicted risks are correctly calibrated across risk categories."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s13058-024-01947-x,""Humans",Female,*Breast Neoplasms/genetics/epidemiology,*Genetic Predisposition to Disease,*Multifactorial Inheritance,*White People/genetics,Risk Assessment/methods,Risk Factors,

Recently, an increasing number of GWAS summary statistics have been made available to the research community, providing extensive repositories for studies of human complex diseases. In particular, cross-trait associations at the genetic level can be beneficial from large-scale GWAS summary statistics by using genetic variants that are associated with multiple traits. However, direct assessment of cross-trait associations using susceptibility loci has been challenging due to the complex genetic architectures in most diseases, calling for advantageous methods that could integrate functional interpretation and imply biological mechanisms. RESULTS: We developed an analytical framework for systematic integration of cross-trait associations. It incorporates two different approaches to detect enriched pathways and requires only summary statistics. We demonstrated the framework using 25 traits belonging to four phenotype groups. Our results revealed an average of 54 significantly associated pathways (ranged between 18 and 175) per trait. We further proved that pathway-based analysis provided increased power to estimate cross-trait associations compared to gene-level analysis. Based on Fisher's Exact Test (FET), we identified a total of 24 (53) pairs of trait-trait association at adjusted p(FET) < 1 × 10(- 3) (p(FET) < 0.01) among the 25 traits. Our trait-trait association network revealed not only many relationships among the traits within the same group but also novel relationships among traits from different groups, which warrants further investigation in future. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that risk variants for 25 different traits aggregated in particular biological pathways and that these pathways were frequently shared among traits. Our results confirmed known mechanisms and also suggested several novel insights into the etiology of multi-traits."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12864-018-5373-7,""Comorbidity",*Gene Regulatory Networks,Genetic Association Studies/methods,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods,Humans,"*Models, Statistical",Phenotype,

The prospects of a widespread and rapid integration of machine learning in clinical workflow have attracted considerable attention including due to complex ethical implications-algorithmic bias being among the most frequently discussed ML models. Here we introduce and discuss a practical ethics framework inductively-generated via normative analysis of the practical challenges in developing an actual clinical ML model (see case study). The framework is usable to identify, measure and address bias in clinical machine learning models, thus improving fairness as to both model performance and health outcomes. We detail a proportionate approach to ML bias by defining the demands of fair ML in light of what is ethically justifiable and, at the same time, technically feasible in light of inevitable trade-offs. Our framework enables ethically robust and transparent decision-making both in the design and the context-dependent aspects of ML bias mitigation, thus improving accountability for both developers and clinical users."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pdig.0000728,"""",40100898,PMC11918422",,,,,,,,

The 9-item version of the EPDS (EPDS-9), which omits item 10, is sometimes used in research due to concern about positive endorsements of item 10 and necessary follow-up. We assessed the equivalence of total score correlations and screening accuracy to detect major depression using the EPDS-9 versus full EPDS among pregnant and postpartum women. We searched Medline, Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from database inception to October 3, 2018 for studies that administered the EPDS and conducted diagnostic classification for major depression based on a validated semi-structured or fully structured interview among women aged 18 or older during pregnancy or within 12 months of giving birth. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis. We calculated Pearson correlations with 95% prediction interval (PI) between EPDS-9 and full EPDS total scores using a random effects model. Bivariate random-effects models were fitted to assess screening accuracy. Equivalence tests were done by comparing the confidence intervals (CIs) around the pooled sensitivity and specificity differences to the equivalence margin of d = 0.05. Individual participant data were obtained from 41 eligible studies (10,906 participants, 1407 major depression cases). The correlation between EPDS-9 and full EPDS scores was 0.998 (95% PI 0.991, 0.999). For sensitivity, the EPDS-9 and full EPDS were equivalent for cut-offs 7-12 (difference range - 0.02, 0.01) and the equivalence was indeterminate for cut-offs 13-15 (all differences - 0.04). For specificity, the EPDS-9 and full EPDS were equivalent for all cut-offs (difference range 0.00, 0.01).

In this context, care for individuals diagnosed with Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCDs) deserves to be highlighted. The aim of this study is to present the creation, development and implementation of the Telehealth Center of the Federal University of Viçosa (NUTELES - UFV), for the monitoring and management of health care for individuals with Arterial Hypertension (AH) and/or Diabetes Mellitus (DM). METHODS: This study, carried out in 2022 and 2023, involved 374 patients diagnosed with AH and/or DM in the health micro-region of Viçosa/MG, Brazil, comprising nine municipalities. The research aims to describe the creation, development and implementation of a software (NutelesApp) for the collection, storage, management and analysis of epidemiological research in public health, focusing specifically, on the monitoring and management of health care for individuals with AH and/or DM monitored by Primary Health Care (PHC). The parameters collected and analyzed were obtained through a questionnaire applied to patients, consisting of 70 questions, subdivided into 12 classes of questions. The epidemiological survey data was collected using mobile devices and analyzed using computer techniques based on statistical analysis. Once the field teams had completed their work, the files were transferred to servers for general analysis processing, using estimates of means, prevalence and respective standard errors, calculated using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program, which takes into account the planning variables and includes the basic weights resulting from the sampling process. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee and registered, prior to recruitment, by the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC), ID: RBR-45hqzmf (Last approval date: 11/30/2022). RESULTS: The information obtained through data collection with subsequent exploratory analysis of epidemiological data using the NutelesApp software suggests that mobile applications intended for the purpose of monitoring and managing healthcare for people with AH and/or DM should address the variables necessary to support a process of understanding the health conditions and/or disease of the individual as a whole and provide short- and long-term learning. Regarding the results of the survey using the software, the variables of 374 people were analyzed. Majority are female (73.2%) and white (43.5%). Most patients are elderly (average 64 years), with blood pressure levels within the normal range for this population, BMI indicates overweight, AC increased risk for cardiovascular events and CC within the recommendation value.

Furthermore, this study aimed to develop a prognostic model that helps clinicians establish the indication of intervention by palliative care teams. Methodology A retrospective study of patients' digital clinical history registry was conducted to meet the two core objectives. The study population was patients with solid tumors undergoing unscheduled admissions to the oncology ward between January 1, 2018, and May 31, 2018. Demographic and clinical variables of those patients were analyzed. Specifically, the statistical analysis involved descriptive analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, Log-Rank, and Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection decision tree modeling. Results The results were obtained from 100 admissions of patients with an average age of 64. Of the patient cases examined, 67% (n = 67) were male. In 72% (n = 72) of the cases, patients presented with Stage IV tumors, and the most frequent primary tumor location among the admissions was lung, at 29% (n = 29). Intervention by the palliative care team occurred for 38% (n = 38) of patients. Mortality at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days was 34% (n = 34), 56% (n = 56), 71% (n = 71), and 78% (n = 78), respectively. Hepatic metastasis was the main predictor of mortality at 30 days (65%, n = 13) and at 90 days (90%, n = 18). In the absence of hepatic metastasis, the presence of more than one symptom predicted a mortality rate of 70% at 30 days. The main factor associated with mortality at 180 and 365 days was the tumor stage, with stage IV tumors having the highest mortality rate (84.7%, n = 61, and 90.3%, n = 65, respectively). Among the Stage IV population, the primary site shows a significant impact on survival, with colorectal/reproductive tumors being associated with decreased mortality.

Past studies have suggested VL can effectively prepare students for clinical settings. Informed by the Milestones of Observable Behaviours for CR (MOBCR) and whole-case theoretical frameworks, the Mock Wards (MW) program was created using a novel blended in-person learning (IPL) and VL platform. MW consisted of case-based small-group formats for medical students interested in learning approaches and differentials to commonly encountered presenting symptoms and diagnoses in internal medicine. This study sought to use MW's blended design to qualitatively analyze CR development and compare its utility between VL and IPL. Methods Qualitative analysis was conducted using in-depth semi-structured interviews with first-year pre-clerkship medical students (n = 8) who completed the MW program and participated in the study. The interview guide was informed by the MOBCR framework. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a directed qualitative content analysis approach. Translational coding and HyperRESEARCH(TM) (Researchware, Inc., Randolph, MA) software-generated mind maps guided the theme development. Results Three overarching themes were constructed: (1) tailoring pedagogical frameworks to learning modalities, (2) learning through interactivity, and (3) balancing accessibility with learner engagement. Participants emphasized that teaching CR skills is modality-specific and not fully interchangeable, with IPL being superior in facilitating social cohesion, non-verbal communication, and feedback. In contrast, VL required structured approaches and relied more on verbal communication and pre-made digital materials. IPL also enhanced interactivity, peer relationships, and spontaneous communication, whereas VL faced challenges such as social awkwardness and technological constraints hindering effective collaboration. VL provided superior accessibility to facilitate distributed learning and management of concurrent academic obligations. Conclusion The MW-blended platform highlights the importance of focusing on modality-tailored pedagogies, emphasizing group interactability, and balancing VL accessibility against decreased engagement within the IPL environment when teaching CR skills. Blended education models may benefit from a scaffolding approach, using IPL as a prerequisite to VL to improve CR development and alignment within a learner's zone of proximal development."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.64954,"""",39040615,PMC11260654",,,,,,,,Transplant Recipients

This study aims to compare the accuracy of two routine measuring instruments, i.e., the digital vernier caliper and the digital thickness gauge, when measuring the thickness of venous specimens multiple times. Methodology In this study, we used 12 tubular vena cava specimens obtained from common breed pigs aged 18-24 weeks at the time of sacrifice from a local slaughterhouse. The measurements were performed using a digital vernier caliper (Multicomp PRO MP012475) for the first four protocols and a digital thickness gauge (Mitutoyo 547-500S) for the fifth protocol. In the first protocol, three measurements were taken on the same side, and their average was recorded as the sample thickness. The second protocol involved taking measurements on two opposite sides, and the average of these measurements was recorded as the sample thickness. In the third protocol, the thickness of each side was measured at its midpoint, and the average of the four measurements was recorded as the sample thickness. In the last protocol using a digital vernier caliper, the thickness of the vernier specimens was calculated as the average of the measurements taken at each corner of the square sample. Finally, for the fifth protocol, three consecutive measurements were taken using the digital thickness gauge, and their average was recorded as the final thickness of the sample. Results In the first protocol, we observed lower values during the first measurement in comparison to the second (0.409 ± 0.063 vs. 0.536 ± 0.064, p < 0.0001) and the third (0.409 ± 0.063 vs. 0.528 ± 0.055, p = 0.0001). Moreover, with the second protocol, we observed lower values during the first two measurements in comparison to the third measurement (p = 0.0279 and p = 0.0054). Regarding protocols three and four, we recorded higher values for the second and third measurements than the first one, with higher values for the third measurement than the second one. In the fifth protocol, there were no significant statistical differences between the three consecutive measurements (p = 0.953, p = 0.742, and p = 0.897). Further, we examined the variations in sample thickness determined using each of the protocols proposed for the digital vernier caliper, as well as the values obtained with the digital thickness gauge protocol. As a result, during the first and second measurements, we observed lower thickness values for the venous wall samples using the first four protocols compared to the fifth protocol (for all p < 0.05). However, no differences were noted between the five protocols during the third measurement. Conclusions The digital thickness gauge Mitutoyo 547-500S provided superior accuracy with no difference between three successive measurements of venous wall thickness, regardless of the examiner's experience. Accurately determining the thickness of venous specimens is crucial for calculating the tissue's biomechanical properties."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.68442,"""",39360102,PMC11445981",,,,,,,,

This is an important area of enquiry because it is now widely recognised that an intervention might lead to different clinical outcomes when delivered as part of a trial than when implemented in routine clinical practice"," however, the reasons for this are not fully understood. METHODS/DESIGN: We interviewed 24 individuals who took part in a trial of an innovative health technology under development for people with type 1 diabetes which automatically regulates blood glucose: the closed-loop system. Participants were interviewed following randomisation to a closed-loop and at trial closeout. RESULTS: Participants provided complex agendas for taking part in which altruistic and self-interested considerations were often inseparable. Many described belonging to a wider diabetes community and being beneficiaries of others' participation in research and how this had given rise to attendant citizenship obligations. Participants also shared the excitement and pride they experienced from contributing to research which situated them at the forefront of technological innovation and enabled them to present themselves to others, by virtue of their trial participation, as ambassadors of hope and research pioneers. Given their desire to support the progression of a potentially life-changing technology, and be part of that innovation, participants, at follow-up, described having made extra effort during the trial. Specifically, participants described having been more focused on their diabetes management to help create conditions in which the closed-loop could work most effectively to optimize their blood glucose control. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute a new dimension to understandings of trial effects"," specifically, we argue that, to aid interpretation of trial outcomes, participants' understandings and motivations for participation need to be considered. We highlight the potential pertinence of our findings in the contemporary era of bio-citizenship where, increasingly, people are driving research agendas and see themselves as co-producers of knowledge. We also recommend a new concept be introduced into the literature-'the altruselfish agenda'-to recognise potential inseparability of self-interested and altruistic motivations.

While accumulating studies highlight expert-level performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on focused classification tasks, most studies rely on probability distribution scores with empirically defined cutoff values based on post-hoc analysis. More generalizable tools that allow humans to visualize histology-based deep learning inferences and decision making are scarce. RESULTS: Here, we leverage t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce dimensionality and depict how CNNs organize histomorphologic information. Unique to our workflow, we develop a quantitative and transparent approach to visualizing classification decisions prior to softmax compression. By discretizing the relationships between classes on the t-SNE plot, we show we can super-impose randomly sampled regions of test images and use their distribution to render statistically-driven classifications. Therefore, in addition to providing intuitive outputs for human review, this visual approach can carry out automated and objective multi-class classifications similar to more traditional and less-transparent categorical probability distribution scores. Importantly, this novel classification approach is driven by a priori statistically defined cutoffs. It therefore serves as a generalizable classification and anomaly detection tool less reliant on post-hoc tuning. CONCLUSION: Routine incorporation of this convenient approach for quantitative visualization and error reduction in histopathology aims to accelerate early adoption of CNNs into generalized real-world applications where unanticipated and previously untrained classes are often encountered."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12859-018-2184-4,""Artificial Intelligence/*standards",Deep Learning/*classification,Humans,Machine Learning/*standards,"*Neural Networks, Computer"",29769044,PMC5956828",,,,Portugal

However, breastfeeding rates remain suboptimal globally, including in the Philippines, due to misinformation, cultural misconceptions, and inadequate healthcare support. Nursing students, as future healthcare providers, play a pivotal role in promoting breastfeeding practices. This study explores the use of LactApp, a mobile health (m-Health) tool, to enhance nursing students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding. Methods A sequential explanatory mixed-methods design was employed, consisting of two phases. In Phase 1, 135 nursing students from the second, third, and fourth years completed a pre-test survey to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding. After utilizing the LactApp tool for three months during their clinical placements, participants completed a post-test to evaluate changes in these areas. Quantitative data, including assessments of the tool's effectiveness and barriers to its use, were analyzed using paired t-tests. In Phase 2, a subset of students participated in semi-structured interviews to explore their experiences and perceptions of using LactApp. Qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis to identify key themes and insights. Results The pre-test and post-test surveys indicated significant improvements in students' breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, and practices after using LactApp. Qualitative interviews revealed that students found LactApp easy to use and valuable in supporting their clinical work. However, some barriers to its use, including technological issues and resistance from mothers, were identified. Students also expressed positive perceptions of incorporating digital tools, like LactApp, into their nursing curricula. Conclusion The use of the LactApp tool effectively enhanced nursing students' breastfeeding knowledge and practices. The integration of m-Health tools in nursing education shows promise in bridging gaps in breastfeeding education and empowering students to support breastfeeding mothers effectively. Future research should focus on overcoming barriers to digital tool integration and expanding its use in nursing curricula to improve maternal and child health outcomes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.77591,"""",39958102,PMC11830403",,,,,,,,

The GAW20 Causal Modeling Working Group has applied complementary approaches (eg, Mendelian randomization, structural equations modeling, Bayesian networks) to discover novel causal effects of genomic and epigenomic variation on lipid phenotypes, as well as to validate prior findings from observational studies. RESULTS: Two Mendelian randomization studies have applied novel approaches to instrumental variable selection in methylation data, identifying bidirectional causal effects of CPT1A and triglycerides, as well as of RNMT and C6orf42, on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to fenofibrate. The CPT1A finding also emerged in a Bayesian network study. The Mendelian randomization studies have implemented both existing and novel steps to account for pleiotropic effects, which were independently detected in the GAW20 data via a structural equation modeling approach. Two studies estimated indirect effects of genomic variation (via DNA methylation and/or correlated phenotypes) on lipid outcomes of interest. Finally, a novel weighted R(2) measure was proposed to complement other causal inference efforts by controlling for the influence of outlying observations. CONCLUSIONS: The GAW20 contributions illustrate the diversity of possible approaches to causal inference in the multi-omic context, highlighting the promises and assumptions of each method and the benefits of integrating both across methods and across omics layers for the most robust and comprehensive insights into disease processes."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12863-018-0645-4,""Bayes Theorem",Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/genetics,"Cholesterol, HDL/blood",DNA Methylation,Fenofibrate/therapeutic use,Genetic Variation,*Genome-Wide Association Study,Humans,

Analysis from a Safety-II stance requires identification of human adjustments in daily work that are key to maintaining safety. The aim of this paper is to describe an approach to explore the consequences of human variability from a Safety-II perspective and describe the added value of this to TES. METHODS: The reader is guided through a novel application of functional resonance analysis methodology (FRAM), a method to analyse how a system or activity is affected by human variability, to explore human adaptations observed in in situ simulations (ISS). The structured applicability of this novel approach to TES is described by application to empirical data from the standardised ISS management of paediatric time critical head injuries (TCHI). RESULTS: A case series is presented to illustrate the step-wise observation of key timings during ISSs, the construction of FRAM models and the visualisation of the propagation of human adaptations through the FRAM models. The key functions/actions that ensure the propagation are visible, as are the sequelae of the adaptations.

There is a pressing need to better characterize and compare trauma scoring tools, especially within research frameworks. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of various trauma scoring tools in predicting in-hospital mortality among trauma patients in South Africa. Methods This study conducted a secondary analysis of existing data from the multicenter Epidemiology and Outcomes of Prolonged Trauma Care (EpiC) study, which included 13,548 adult trauma patients aged 18 years and older, collected between August 2021 and March 2024. The predictive ability of the scoring tools was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results The mortality rate was 2.5% (n = 298). The Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) demonstrated the highest predictive ability for seven-day in-hospital mortality, with an AUROC of 0.95 and an AUPRC of 0.53. Similarly, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) and the New Injury Severity Score (NISS) also exhibited strong predictive capabilities, with AUROC values of 0.96 and AUPRC values of 0.62 for TRISS and an AUROC of 0.96 and AUPRC of 0.53 for NISS. In contrast, the Revised Trauma Score and Mechanism, Glasgow Coma Scale, Age, and Arterial Pressure (MGAP) showed lower predictive performance, with AUROC values of 0.87 (AUPRC = 0.51) and 0.86 (AUPRC = 0.47), respectively. Conclusions The KTS exhibited optimal performance characteristics for retrospectively predicting mortality in our cohort, outperforming other scoring tools. Notably, it is also the simplest scoring tool, featuring the fewest variables compared to other trauma severity assessments. These findings highlight the necessity for external validation of trauma scoring tools in resource-limited populations to ensure their applicability and effectiveness in trauma research across diverse healthcare settings."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.71225,"""",39399278,PMC11469657",,,,,,,,

To determine the hematologic toxicities during concurrent chemotherapy for cervical cancer, we evaluated these two therapies (cisplatin or carboplatin). Hematologic markers have been studied using statistical models and descriptive statistics. Artificial intelligence models were built using the treatment data and all the information gathered from each patient after one or more administrations to forecast the CC stage. The information was gathered from stage III cervical cancer patients and provided by Oncohelp Hospital from the West Region of Romania. Many traditional machine learning techniques, such as naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), decision trees (DTs), and a trained transformer called TabPFN, were used in the current study to obtain the tabular data. The algorithms NB, RF, and DTs yielded the greatest classification score of 100% when it came to cervical cancer prediction. On the other hand, TabPFN demonstrated an accuracy of 88%. The effectiveness of the models was evaluated by computing the computational complexity of traditional machine learning methods. Early detection increases the likelihood of a good prognosis during the precancerous and malignant stages. Being aware of any indications and symptoms of cervical cancer can also help to prevent delays in diagnosis. These hematologic toxicities, which have been demonstrated to grow linearly with lowering hematologic markers below their normal expectations, would significantly impair patients' quality of life."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.70665,"""",39493069,PMC11528638",,,,,,,,

However, approaches to involve and evaluate 'meaningful involvement' in complex qualitative mental health research, and how to evaluate impacts (or change) for the co-researcher and the research is less well defined. OBJECTIVES: This co-produced research explored the experiences of YP seeking help for emotional abuse and neglect via an online, peer-peer message board. This practical case study aims to evidence the meaningful role and impacts associated with YCoR involvement in sensitive and complex mental health research using a flexible approach to co-production. METHODS: During the Covid-19 pandemic, we explored on- and off-line approaches and adapted research methodology to build relationships, knowledge, skills, and confidence with YCoR. The virtual involvement was evaluated against the five principles of co-production. Anonymous, continuous digital feedback, reflective practices and multiple dissemination outputs are used to evaluate the impact of the study on those involved and the research. RESULTS: Ten members of NeurOX Young People's Advisory Group were involved in the core project. Additional members were invited at later stages and in the dissemination of outputs. We describe a supportive, scaffolded learning approach to build capabilities and embed the lived experience of YCoR in complex qualitative research. A digital blended approach was acceptable to YCoR, principles of co-production were met and the impact/benefits of involvement are described. To demonstrate the epistemological value of involving YP we evidence YPs capabilities for involvement and the 'change' or contribution YCoR made to the research through reflective practices. CONCLUSIONS: This case study demonstrates how flexible approaches co-production with YCoR can be robust and responsive to balance ethical and epistemological impact in complex mental health research. Supportive, scaffolded practices and safe environments helped build the confidence and capacity of YCoRs to demonstrate valuable phenomenological insights in the analysis. YP's perspectives on how they describe 'meaningful' and impactful involvement illustrate the reciprocal benefits gained through working together.

Although many studies have investigated the risk factors for BDD in confined dairy systems, information on risk factors in pasture-based system is limited. Therefore a cross-sectional study including 59,849 animals from 127 dairy herds in four regions of New Zealand was conducted to identify the herd-level factors associated with the probability of a herd being BDD-lesion positive and with within-herd BDD prevalence. RESULTS: Purchasing heifers was associated with increased odds of a herd being BDD-lesion positive (odds ratio [OR]: 2.33, 95% probability interval [PI]: 1.26-4.42) and a cow being BDD affected (OR: 3.76, 95%PI: 1.73-8.38), respectively. Higher odds of a herd being BDD-lesion positive (OR: 2.06, 95%PI: 1.17-3.62) and a cow being BDD affected (OR: 2.87, 95%PI: 1.43-5.94) were also seen in herds where heifers co-grazed with cattle from other properties. In addition, using outside staff to treat lameness was associated with higher odds of a cow being BDD affected (OR: 2.18, 95%PI: 0.96-4.98). CONCLUSION: This study highlighted that movements of heifers are significantly associated with the spread of BDD within and between dairy herds in New Zealand. To minimise the risk of disease introductions in herds where moving heifers cannot be avoided, it is best to purchase heifers only from herds where BDD-freedom has been confirmed and, if heifers have to graze-off a farm, they should be reared as a single biosecure management group, especially since animals may be BDD-infected without having clinically obvious lesions."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12917-019-1871-3,""Animals",Bayes Theorem,Cattle,Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology,Digital Dermatitis/*epidemiology,Female,"Models, Biological",Multivariate Analysis,

Introducing this complex technology into an already complex health system is a significant challenge that cannot be managed in a reductionist way. To build robust and sustainable, high quality delivery systems we need to step back and view the interconnected landscape of policymakers, funders, managers, multidisciplinary teams of clinicians, patients and their families, and health care, research, education, and philanthropic institutions as a dynamic whole. This study holistically mapped the landscape of clinical genomics within Australia by developing a complex graphic: a rich picture. Using complex systems theory, we then identified key features, challenges and leverage points of implementing clinical genomics. METHODS: We used a multi-stage, exploratory, qualitative approach. We extracted data from grey literature, empirical literature, and data collected by the Australian Genomic Health Alliance. Nine key informants working in clinical genomics critiqued early drafts of the picture, and validated the final version. RESULTS: The final graphic depicts 24 stakeholder groups relevant to implementation of genomics into Australia. Clinical genomics lies at the intersection of four nested systems, with interplay between government, professional bodies and patient advocacy groups. Barriers and uncertainties are also shown. Analysis using complexity theory showed far-reaching interdependencies around funding, and identified unintended consequences. CONCLUSION: The rich picture of the clinical genomic landscape in Australia is the first to show key stakeholders, agencies and processes and their interdependencies. Participants who critiqued our results were instantly intrigued and engaged by the graphics, searching for their place in the whole and often commenting on insights they gained from seeing the influences and impacts of other stakeholder groups on their own work. Funding patterns showed unintended consequences of increased burdens for clinicians and inequity of access for patients. Showing the system as a dynamic whole is the only way to understand key drivers and barriers to largescale interventions.

The short article aims to explore how AI technologies, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), have started to be used to analyze qualitative data. While this can speed up the analysis process, it has also sparked debates within the interpretive paradigm about the validity and ethics of these methods. I argue that research underpinned by the human researcher for contextual understanding and final interpretation should mostly remain with the researcher. AI might overlook the subtleties of human communication. This is because automated programmes with clear rules and formulae do not work well-under interpretivism's assumptions. Nevertheless, AI may be embraced in qualitative research in a partial automation process that enables researchers to conduct rigorous, rapid studies that more easily incorporate the many benefits of qualitative research. It is possible that AI and other technological advancements may lead to new research paradigms that better underpin the contemporary digital researcher. For example, we might see the rise of a """"computational"""" paradigm.

We introduce a cognitive task analysis (CTA) approach consisting of interviews, structured observations, and expert consensus to systematically elicit information for medical simulator development. Specifically, our objective was to introduce a guideline for development and application of a modified CTA to obtain task demands of surgical procedures for all three OR professions with comprehensive definitions of OR teams' technical and non-technical skills. METHODS: To demonstrate our methodological approach, we applied it in vertebroplasty, a minimally invasive spine procedure. We used a CTA consisting of document reviews, in situ OR observations, expert interviews, and an expert consensus panel. Interviews included five surgeons, four OR nurses, and four anesthetists. Ten procedures were observed. Data collection was carried out in five OR theaters in Germany. RESULTS: After compiling data from interviews and observations, we identified 6 procedural steps with 21 sub-steps for surgeons, 20 sub-steps for nurses, and 22 sub-steps for anesthetists. Additionally, we obtained information on 16 predefined categories of intra-operative skills and requirements for all three OR professions. Finally, simulation requirements for intra-operative demands were derived and specified in the expert panel.

Recent studies have explored a plausible association between retinopathy and significant liver fibrosis. The aim of this investigation was to develop a sophisticated machine learning (ML) model, leveraging comprehensive clinical datasets, to forecast the likelihood of significant liver fibrosis in patients with retinopathy and to interpret the ML model by applying the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. METHODS: This inquiry was based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2008 cohort. Utilizing the Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), liver fibrosis was stratified across a spectrum of grades (F0-F4). The severity of retinopathy was determined using retinal imaging and segmented into four discrete gradations. A ten-fold cross-validation approach was used to gauge the propensity towards liver fibrosis. Eight ML methodologies were used: Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, multilayer perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression (LR), Plain Bayes, Decision Tree, and k-nearest neighbors. The efficacy of these models was gauged using metrics, such as the area under the curve (AUC). The SHAP method was deployed to unravel the intricacies of feature importance and explicate the inner workings of the ML model. RESULTS: The analysis included 5,364 participants, of whom 2,116 (39.45%) exhibited notable liver fibrosis. Following random allocation, 3,754 individuals were assigned to the training set and 1,610 were allocated to the validation cohort. Nine variables were curated for integration into the ML model. Among the eight ML models scrutinized, the LR model attained zenith in both AUC (0.867, 95% CI: 0.855-0.878) and F1 score (0.749, 95% CI: 0.732-0.767). In internal validation, this model sustained its superiority, with an AUC of 0.850 and an F1 score of 0.736, surpassing all other ML models. The SHAP methodology unveils the foremost factors through importance ranking. CONCLUSION: Sophisticated ML models were crafted using clinical data to discern the propensity for significant liver fibrosis in patients with retinopathy and to intervene early.

Taxonomists and conservationists are engaged in vigorous discussions over the necessity of killing animals for specimen sampling, but quantitative data on taxonomic trends and specimen sampling over time, which could inform these debates, are lacking. METHODS: We interrogated a long-term research database documenting 2,723 land vertebrate and 419 invertebrate taxa from Madagascar, and their associated specimens conserved in the major natural history museums. We further compared specimen collection and species description rates for the birds, mammals and scorpions over the last two centuries, to identify trends and links to taxon descriptions. RESULTS: We located 15,364 specimens documenting endemic mammals and 11,666 specimens documenting endemic birds collected between 1820 and 2010. Most specimens were collected at the time of the Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine (MZFAA) in the 1930s and during the last two decades, with major differences according to the groups considered. The small mammal and bat collections date primarily from recent years, and are paralleled by the description of new species. Lemur specimens were collected during the MZFAA but the descriptions of new taxa are recent, with the type series limited to non-killed specimens. Bird specimens, particularly of non-passerines, are mainly from the time of the MZFAA. The passerines have also been intensely collected during the last two decades"," the new material has been used to solve the phylogeny of the groups and only two new endemic taxa of passerine birds have been described over the last two decades. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that specimen collection has been critical for advancing our understanding of the taxonomy of Madagascar's biodiversity at the onset of zoological work in Madagascar, but less so in recent decades. It is crucial to look for alternatives to avoid killing animals in the name of documenting life, and encourage all efforts to share the information attached to historical and recent collections held in natural history museums. In times of conservation crisis and the advancement in digital technologies and open source sharing, it seems obsolete to kill animals in well-known taxonomic groups for the sake of enriching natural history collections around the world."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1371/journal.pone.0183903,""Animals",*Biodiversity,Birds/classification,Classification/*methods,Conservation of Natural Resources/*methods/*trends,Endangered Species,Madagascar,

This implies parents should also be involved in the most critical patient safety measures. Hand hygiene is the single most important tool to prevent healthcare-associated infections and related long-term effects. Although often studied in healthcare workers, the hand hygiene compliance of parents is rarely assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational video, available in ten different languages, in teaching parents hand hygiene techniques in a NICU, lowering the burden on the staff. METHODS: Parents in the intervention group were educated through a video"," the control group received personal instruction from healthcare workers. The primary outcome parameter was the predicted probability of passing a subsequent hand scan. RESULTS: The quality of hand hygiene among parents educated through the video was at least as good as that of those who received instruction from a healthcare worker, demonstrated by a higher predicted probability of passing the hand scan (43.8% vs. 57.1% in male and 67.9% vs. 75.9% in female participants). The feedback from the intervention group was predominantly positive, with most parents (62%) expressing a preference for video-based education. CONCLUSION: Implementing a video-based approach seems to be effective for educating parents about hand hygiene in a NICU and was well accepted by the parents.

Shotgun metagenomics is a broad diagnostic tool that can be useful for identifying multiple microbes simultaneously especially if coupled with lymph node aspirates, a clinical matrix known to house disparate pathogens. The objective of this study was to analyze the utility of this unconventional diagnostic approach (shotgun metagenomics) using clinical samples from human tularemia cases as a test model. Tularemia, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, is an emerging infectious disease in Turkey. This disease commonly manifests as swelling of the lymph nodes nearest to the entry of infection. Because swollen cervical nodes are observed from many different types of human infections we used these clinical sample types to analyze the utility of shotgun metagenomics. METHODS: We conducted an unbiased molecular survey using shotgun metagenomics sequencing of DNA extracts from fine-needle aspirates of neck lymph nodes from eight tularemia patients who displayed protracted symptoms. The resulting metagenomics data were searched for microbial sequences (bacterial and viral). RESULTS: F. tularensis sequences were detected in all samples. In addition, we detected DNA of other known pathogens in three patients. Both Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Human Parvovirus B-19 were detected in one individual and Human Parvovirus B-19 alone was detected in two other individuals. Subsequent PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing verified the metagenomics results. The HBV status was independently confirmed via serological diagnostics, despite evading notice during the initial assessment. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight that shotgun metagenomics of fine-needle lymph node aspirates is a promising clinical diagnostic strategy to identify coinfections. Given the feasibility of the diagnostic approach demonstrated here, further steps to promote integration of this type of diagnostic capability into mainstream clinical practice are warranted."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s12879-018-3218-2,""Coinfection/*diagnosis","DNA, Bacterial/genetics/metabolism",Female,Francisella tularensis/*genetics/isolation & purification,Humans,Lymph Nodes/*microbiology/pathology,Male,*Metagenomics,

It also aimed to determine the validity and reliability of a questionnaire designed to assess the quality of educational software tailored to these lesions. Materials and methods This descriptive cross-sectional study involved 102 dental students from Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran, who had completed the theoretical course on oral exophytic lesions. A paper questionnaire, including 23 items, assessed their clinical knowledge, the efficacy and limitations of existing educational resources, and the need for interactive electronic courseware (e-courseware). The questionnaire's validity and reliability were evaluated through expert feedback and statistical measures (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha). Results Students' answers to the seven items about evaluating their clinical diagnosis knowledge of oral exophytic lesions were between four and five items correct on average. This finding indicated that students' overall skill in diagnosing exophytic lesions was poor to moderate. The study highlighted a moderate level of self-assessed clinical ability in diagnosing oral exophytic lesions among students (62.7%), with a preference for textbooks and color atlases as primary information sources. The disadvantages of existing electronic resources were noted, alongside a strong student consensus (88.23%) on the need for interactive e-courseware featuring comprehensive, visually engaging content for differential diagnosis education. The reliability and validity analyses of the questionnaire underscored its appropriateness for assessing educational needs. In this regard, ICC for the usability of scientific context, training ability, and interaction was 0.92, 0.73, and 0.82, respectively. Also, Cronbach's alpha score was at 0.90. Conclusion The research underscores a significant gap in dental students' knowledge and diagnostic skills regarding oral exophytic lesions. It emphasizes the critical need for an innovative, interactive educational tool that aligns with contemporary students' digital learning preferences. The envisioned e-courseware would facilitate self-learning and address current resources' limitations, potentially transforming dental education by enhancing clinical diagnostic skills through accessible, effective, and engaging digital content."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.7759/cureus.69867,"""",39435216,PMC11493466",,,,,,,,

The full text of all #MedTwitterAI tweets was also extracted and subjected to a natural language processing analysis. RESULTS: Over this time period, we identified 7,441 tweets containing #MedTwitterAI, posted by 1,519 unique Twitter users which generated 59,455,569 impressions. The most common identifiable locations for users including this hashtag in tweets were the United States (378/1,519), the United Kingdom (80/1,519), Canada (65/1,519), India (46/1,519), Spain (29/1,519), France (24/1,519), Italy (16/1,519), Australia (16/1,519), Germany (16/1,519), and Brazil (15/1,519). Tweets were frequently enhanced with links (80.2%), mentions of other accounts (93.9%), and photos (56.6%). The five most abundant single words were AI (artificial intelligence), patients, medicine, data, and learning. Sentiment analysis revealed an overall majority of positive single word sentiments (e.g., intelligence, improve) with 230 positive and 172 negative sentiments with a total of 658 and 342 mentions of all positive and negative sentiments, respectively. Most frequently mentioned negative sentiments were cancer, risk, and bias. Most common bigrams identified by Markov chain depiction were related to analytical methods (e.g., label-free detection) and medical conditions/biological processes (e.g., rare circulating tumor cells). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the generated considerable interest of using #MedTwitterAI for promoting relevant content and engaging a broad and geographically diverse audience. The use of hashtags in Twitter-based campaigns can be an effective tool to raise awareness of interdisciplinary fields and enable knowledge-sharing on a global scale."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.3389/fpubh.2022.856571,Artificial Intelligence",Brazil,Germany,Humans,*Social Media,Spain,"United States,35844878,PMC9283788",,

However, the care received is often insufficiently coordinated between different specialties and health-care providers. This study aims to describe the characteristics of HND patients and to explore the initial effects of a multidisciplinary and person-centered care on total care utilization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a sub-study of HND patients recruited in an ongoing randomized trial CareHND (NCT03362983). Descriptive statistics of patient characteristics, including diagnostic data and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, informed a comparison of care utilization patterns between HND patient care and traditional care. Diagnostic and care utilization data were collected from a regional database. Wilcoxon signed ranked sum tests were performed to compare care utilization frequencies between the two groups. RESULTS: Patients included in the study were care-intensive with several diagnoses and experienced a high level of variation in care utilization and diagnoses profiles. HND patients were sicker than their counterparts in the control group. Utilization indicators were similar between the two arms. There was some indication that the HND center is beginning to perform as expected, but no results were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study sits among many studies reporting difficulties obtaining statistically significant findings for MCC patients. However, previous research has shown that the key components of this intervention, such as integrated, multidisciplinary, inter-professional collaboration within patient-centered care have had a positive effect on health-care outcomes. More innovative methods beyond the RCT, such as machine learning should be explored to evaluate the impact of integrated care interventions on care utilization."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2147/JMDH.S214770,"""",31920324,PMC6935286",,,,,,,

This paper describes methods and findings related to the alpha testing of eLearning modules developed as part of the Housing First Technical Assistance and Training (HFTAT) program's development. Alpha testing is an approach for improving the quality of a product prior to beta (i.e., real world) testing with potential applications for intervention development. METHODS: Ten participants in two cities tested the modules. We collected data through (1) a structured log where participants were asked to record their experiences as they worked through the modules", (2) a brief online questionnaire delivered at the end of each module," and (3) focus groups. RESULTS: The alpha test provided useful data related to the acceptability and feasibility of eLearning as an implementation strategy, as well as identifying a number of technical issues and bugs. Each of the qualitative methods used provided unique and valuable information. In particular, logs were the most useful for identifying technical issues, and focus groups provided high quality data regarding how the intervention could best be used as an implementation strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Alpha testing was a valuable step in intervention development, providing us an understanding of issues that would have been more difficult to address at a later stage of the study. As a result, we were able to improve the modules prior to pilot testing of the entire HFTAT. Researchers wishing to alpha test interventions prior to piloting should balance the unique benefits of different data collection approaches with the need to minimize burdens for themselves and participants."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.1186/s40814-017-0187-y,"""",29093826,PMC5663117",,,,,,

We instead focus here on the ethical issues arising from the use of big data in international neuroscience collaborations. Neuroscience innovation relies upon neuroinformatics, large-scale data collection and analysis enabled by novel and emergent technologies. Each step of this work involves aspects of ethics, ranging from concerns for adherence to informed consent or animal protection principles and issues of data re-use at the stage of data collection, to data protection and privacy during data processing and analysis, and issues of attribution and intellectual property at the data-sharing and publication stages. Significant dilemmas and challenges with far-reaching implications are also inherent, including reconciling the ethical imperative for openness and validation with data protection compliance and considering future innovation trajectories or the potential for misuse of research results. Furthermore, these issues are subject to local interpretations within different ethical cultures applying diverse legal systems emphasising different aspects.

This is particularly true for frameworks such as PARIHS/i-PARIHS. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to examine if and why the PARIHS/i-PARIHS framework has been applied in research with other implementation frameworks. METHODS: We searched six databases from 2016 (the year following i-PARIHS' publication) to April 2024 and supplemented this with a citation search of the seminal i-PARIHS paper. We included studies that 1) were peer-reviewed with a protocol or empirical study design, 2) have applied the PARIHS or i-PARIHS framework for implementation planning, delivery, analysis, or evaluation and 3) also used at least one other implementation framework. Descriptive statistics were conducted to report on study characteristics and frequency for each implementation framework used with PARIHS/i-PARIHS. A qualitative, content analysis was used to analyse the answers to open-ended extraction questions. RESULTS: Thirty-six articles met criteria for inclusion and included 16 protocols and 20 empirical articles (twelve intervention and eight cross-sectional studies). Thirty-four of the studies used one additional implementation framework and two studies used two additional implementation frameworks. In total, nine implementation frameworks were applied with PARIHS/i-PARIHS, including: 1) RE-AIM, 2) CFIR, 3) NPT, 4) REP, 5) TDF, 6), DSF, 7) KTA, 8) Stetler's Model, and 9) SIF. Thirty-four reported a rationale for using PARIHS/i-PARIHS and 34 reported a rationale for using the other implementation framework. Only eleven reported a rationale for using more than one implementation framework. Only three reported strengths of combining implementation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review identified that implementation researchers are using PARIHS/i-PARIHS in combination with other implementation frameworks and providing little to no rationale for why. Use of multiple implementation frameworks without detailed rationales compromises our ability to evaluate mechanisms of effectiveness. Implementation researchers and practitioners need to be more explicit about their framework selection, detailing the complementary strengths of the frameworks that are being used in combination, including why using one is not sufficient.

In our study protocol, we complement prior experiences in DV prevention by promoting protective factors (or assets) against gender violence such as communication skills, empathy and problem-solving capability through """"Cinema Voice"""", a participatory educational intervention based on adolescents' strengths to tackle DV. METHODS/DESIGN: A longitudinal quasi-experimental educational intervention addressed to boys and girls ages 13-17 years, enrolled in secondary education schools in Alicante (Spain), Rome (Italy), Cardiff (UK), Iasi (Romania), Poznan (Poland) and Matosinhos (Portugal). Both process and results evaluations will be carried out with 100-120 intervention and 120-150 control group students per city at three time periods: before, after and 6 months after the implementation of the following interventions: 1) Training seminar with teachers to promote knowledge and skills on the core issues of intervention"," 2) Workshops with intervention groups, where participants produce their own digital content presenting their perspective on DV"," and 3) Short film exhibitions with participants, their families, authorities and other stakeholders with the objective of share the results and engage the community. Outcome measures are self-perceived social support, machismo, sexism, tolerance towards gender violence, social problem-solving and assertiveness as well as involvement in bullying/cyberbullying.

Identifying and characterizing influential patients is a first step in future hemodialysis clinic social network interventions to promote kidney transplantation. BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis clinics help develop patient social networks that may spread kidney transplant (KT) attitudes and behaviors. Identifying influential social network members is an important first step to increase KT rates. We mapped the social networks of two hemodialysis facilities to identify which patients were influential using in-degree centrality as a proxy for popularity and influence. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we performed a sociocentric social network analysis of patients on hemodialysis in two geographically and demographically different hemodialysis facilities. Statistical and social network analyses were performed using R statistical software. RESULTS: More patients at facility 1 (N=71) were waitlisted/evaluating living donor KT (50.7% versus 20.0%, P = 0.021), considered KT as very important (70.4% versus 45.0%, P = 0.019), and knew people who received a successful KT (1.0 versus 0.0, P = 0.003).

To capture the breadth of the competencies of an LHS scientist, AHRQ and national experts defined a series of 42 competencies across seven domains that support success. Clinicians, researchers, and leaders who are new to the LHS field can identify and prioritize proficiency development among these domains. In addition, existing leaders and researchers will assemble teams of experts who together represent the LHS science domains. To serve LHS workforce development and proficiency assessment, the AHRQ-funded ACCELERAT K12 training program recruited domain experts and trainees to define and operationalize items to include in an LHS Competency Assessment to support emerging and existing LHS scientists in prioritizing and monitoring proficiency development. METHODS: Sequential interviews with 18 experts iteratively defined skills and tasks to illustrate stage in proficiency, and its progression, for each of 42 competencies in the seven LHS expertise domains: systems science", research questions and standards of scientific evidence, research methods, informatics, ethics of research and implementation in health systems, improvement and implementation science," and engagement, leadership, and research management. An educational assessment expert and LHS scientist refined the assessment criteria at each stage to use parallel language across domains. Last, current trainees reviewed and pilot tested the assessment and the LHS Competency Assessment was further refined using their feedback. The assessment framework was informed by Bloom's revised taxonomy of educational objectives (Anderson and Krathwohl, A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, 2001) where learning progresses from recalling, defining, understanding, and awareness at the lower levels of the taxonomy, to applying and adopting and finally to creating, designing, and critiquing at the upper levels of the taxonomy. We also developed assessment criteria that could be used for longer term assessment of direct performance. Van der Vleuten et al. (Best Pract Res Clin Obstetr Gynaecol. 2010","24(6):703-719) define longer term direct assessment methods as assessment that occurs over a period ranging from weeks to even years and involves multiple assessment methods and exposure to the learner's work over an extended period.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide recommendations for suitable interventions regarding different chronic diseases, but a deficiency in the implementation of these CPGs has been identified. The PITeS-TiiSS (Telemedicine and eHealth Innovation Platform: Information Communications Technology for Research and Information Challenges in Health Services) tool, a personalized ontology-based clinical decision support system (CDSS), aims to reduce variability, prevent errors, and consider interactions between different CPG recommendations, among other benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to design, develop, and validate an ontology-based CDSS that provides personalized recommendations related to drug prescription. The target population is older adult patients with chronic diseases and polypharmacy, and the goal is to reduce complications related to these types of conditions while offering integrated care. METHODS: A study scenario about atrial fibrillation and treatment with anticoagulants was selected to validate the tool. After this, a series of knowledge sources were identified, including CPGs, PROFUND index, LESS/CHRON criteria, and STOPP/START criteria, to extract the information. Modeling was carried out using an ontology, and mapping was done with Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT"," International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation). Once the CDSS was developed, validation was carried out by using a retrospective case study. RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2015 and approved by the Virgen del Rocio University Hospital ethics committee on November 24, 2015. Two different tasks were carried out to test the functioning of the tool. First, retrospective data from a real patient who met the inclusion criteria were used. Second, the analysis of an adoption model was performed through the study of the requirements and characteristics that a CDSS must meet in order to be well accepted and used by health professionals. The results are favorable and allow the proposed research to continue to the next phase. CONCLUSIONS: An ontology-based CDSS was successfully designed, developed, and validated. However, in future work, validation in a real environment should be performed to ensure the tool is usable and reliable."",""RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""lualevale@gmail.com""""=>""""Included""""}"",10.2196/27990,"""",35916719,PMC9382545",,,,,,,

Most tools achieved supporting evidence level for both pathogenic and benign classification using newly established thresholds. Multiple tools reached score thresholds justifying moderate and several reached strong evidence levels. One tool reached very strong evidence level for benign classification on some variants.
