(If so, transcribe)","According to the introduction of the article, yes, the text provides data and references that contextualize the problem. Here are some examples:

* ""The recent drive to create biobanks and data repositories to store genetic, phenotypic, and other health-related data generated from and for biomedical research is intended to encourage and facilitate data sharing for secondary research purposes."" (Reference: The concept of biobanks and data repositories)
* ""Researchers are increasingly prompted by funders, research organizations, and journals to make their data easily accessible."" (Reference: Funders, research organizations, and journals emphasizing the importance of data sharing)
* ""Data sharing helps to optimize investment from public funds and strengthen the statistical power and rigor of research."" (Reference: The benefits of data sharing in biomedical research)
* ""Researchers have an ethical duty to make better use of data and avoid unnecessary repetition, particularly in genetic studies, which extract human biological samples for analysis."" (Reference: The importance of responsible data use and avoiding repetition in genetic studies)

These references provide context for the problem of data governance and sharing in biomedical research."
